** *Description*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: description
   :END:
This undergraduate course introduces students to the material cultures
surrounding disability, the social meaning of “health” technologies, and
the lived experiences of those who deploy, resist, and wrestle with
technologies aimed at their bodies and minds.

Having successfully completed this course, undergraduate students will
be able to:

- Identify landmarks in the history of technologies for disabilities
- Understand the social and medical models of disability and how those
  play into technological design
- Recognize and critique common narratives and assumptions about
  technology and disability 
- Analyze the relationship between disability studies and engineering
  orientations of disability
- Discuss contemporary issues and controversies about technologies for
  disability communities
- Identify, lift up, and defend the voices of disabled people in the
  context of policy and engineering
- Recognize ableism in social narratives about technology and disability

Students will also play an active role in the development of classroom
content, working through material in teams, and engaging with literature
on their selected topics. Specific topics include:

- Cochlear ear implants and hearing aids
- Prosthetic arms and legs
- Exoskeletons
- Text-to-speech interfaces
- Apps for ipads aimed at a people with disabilities
- Closed captioning
- ADA specifications
- Mobility aids (wheelchairs, crutches, scooters, canes)
- Genetic interventions
- Other technologies as incorporated by student choice

We will pay close attention to the historical and social contexts within
which technologies are aimed at disabilities, resistance to and
acceptance of technologies, and identity and passing in the context of
technologies. In all these things, we will take disabled people as
experts on the experience of disability and on disability-related
technologies.

** *Classroom Accessibility for all students*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: classroom-accessibility-for-all-students
   :END:
***** *Disability rights are civil rights, and disabled people fought
hard to secure the rights to your accommodations in the classroom and
workplace. Those people who fought for your accommodations were spit on,
arrested, isolated, and dismissed, but they wouldn't take less than they
deserve when it came to securing your rights to things like access
education and other public goods. They are my heroes, and their work
also works to accommodate me as a multiply disabled university employee.
You can bet that I really want you to use your accommodations, or help
you get them if you don't have any in place, or find a system that works
for us if you don't care to go through the official channels. Most
requests are easy -- and you don't have to be disabled or diagnosed to
request from me; I am happy to distribute any in-class readings in
larger or otherwise more accessible fonts, disability issue or not! And,
if you need text-to-speech software to read aloud with you, I would love
to introduce you to my friends in Accessible Technologies and then make
sure you get the formats you need to use the AT. *

** *Attendance and Participation*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: attendance-and-participation
   :END:
While I do not take attendance as such for our Monday and Wednesday
meetings, your TAs are welcome to take attendance on Friday. Class
participation and engagement are an essential part of this course, and
so missing many classes will work against your engagement and robust
participation. However, I know attendance is not always possible, and I
will make some materials available. Participation and engagement also
doesn't always mean talking a lot in class -- but in taking the
materials we cover seriously and reflectively, which can flow through
how you engage with the course. We will meet by Zoom. Absences, tardy
arrivals, and early departures interfere with your concentration and
ability to take advantage of this course, but, also, I would rather have
people attend some of a class than miss it all.

** *Technology, Tricks, and OK Zoomers*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: technology-tricks-and-ok-zoomers
   :END:
Make space for your own participation and full engagement. Close your
other tabs (or reduce them) as we are in class together. Do the
readings/watchings, come to class with questions, pay attention to guest
speakers. It may help you to take notes on paper or other surface as we
Zoom. If you need other technologies or formats, please let me know.
Zoom does not not have auto-captioning for this campus yet, but I do
know of other tools and formats to work around if we need to.

If you want captioning or would benefit from it (meaning, maybe you
retain more information when you listen and read at the same time),
[[https://webcaptioner.com/captioner][Web Captioner]] (which you would
open and use in a browser tab) does a pretty good job for computer
generated captions, so does [[https://otter.ai/login][Otter.ai]]. For
voice-to-text, some of us also keep a Googledoc open and use the “voice
typing” tool (doc > Tools > Voice Typing). All of these can be useful in
helping you to produce transcripts from presentations; they always
require some correction. If you have accommodations for captioning,
/please/ do let me know because then we can get a live human captioner
looped into our Zoom sessions if that is the case! The university also
has
[[https://www.assist.vt.edu/services/at-network-software/read-write.html][Read
& Write]] (toolbar) for anyone who wants things read aloud.

A few Zoom guidelines (not hard rules) from your professor:

- You don't have to dress up, but please wear clothes. This one is a
  rule.
- You don't have to keep your video on, but it would be useful to your
  professor (as someone who is hard of hearing) if you could please turn
  on your video when you speak or are waiting to speak. 
- You are welcome to use the chat feature in Zoom for questions,
  especially if you are having AV trouble or your mic is crackly. I'll
  ask my TAs to keep an eye on the chat, but anyone is welcome to turn
  on their mic to alert me to a question if I am cruising onto some
  other topic.
- Yes, I'd like to meet your pets. I'll start the Zoom at 10am if
  anyone's good puppers or cattos would like to be a Zoom celebrity
  before we start class at 10:10am.  
- Please stop your prof or instructor if we are going too fast, if AV is
  problematic, or if you have a question. You can do this by turning
  your camera on and raising your hand or using Zoom chat.

** *Honor Code*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: honor-code
   :END:
The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university
community agrees to abide by states: “As a Hokie, I will conduct myself
with honor and integrity at all times.  I will not lie, cheat, or steal,
nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the
Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to
any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the
course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation.
Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University
community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.

For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit:
[[https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/]]

Please ask questions as we go if you want clarification on what is
expected in this course.

** *Mandatory Reporting*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mandatory-reporting
   :END:
Please be advised that, in the capacity as faculty members at Virginia
Tech, your instructor and TAs are mandatory reporters, which means that
we are obligated to notify the Title IX Office at Virginia Tech if we
are given knowledge about sexual assault or violence by other employees
and students. Confidential sources, those who do not have to report to
the Title IX Office, include staff members at the
[[https://healthcenter.vt.edu/][Schiffert Health Center]], the
[[https://ucc.vt.edu/][Cook Counseling Center]], Virginia Tech Mental
Health Centers, and [[https://www.womenscenter.vt.edu/][The Virginia
Tech Women's Center]].

** *Additional Notes*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: additional-notes
   :END:
If you are a student who faces food insecurity, domestic violence, or
issues with housing, including issues related to covid19, please contact
the Dean of Students Office in Student Affairs. They can also help
arrange medical leave and help students in crisis.
[[https://www.dos.vt.edu/]]

I know, and you know, that there's a global pandemic of covid19
happening right now. We will all try to be gentle with each other,
recognizing interdependence as a core value and vulnerability as a
condition we all share. 

** *Grading -- Choose Your Own Adventure System*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: grading-choose-your-own-adventure-system
   :END:
We (your TAs and prof) have a menu of choices for some of what you turn
in. If you want to propose something different to be graded on, we are
also open to those conversations. Please turn in your “Adventure Plan”
for the semester -- that is, what you are choosing as your assigned work
with descriptions of the item and short descriptions of what you plan to
do (1 page) by September 11, 2020. 

*Choose 3 of the following options for 75% of your grade (25% each):*

- Group Book Project: People who are interested in Group Book Project
  will be grouped together in groups of <4 people, and will subsequently
  be given a list of potential books to decide upon which they would
  like to present to the class during the last weeks of class.
  Presentations can be pre-recorded (and captioned) or done live during
  our class time. Projects should include a study guide of the book
  describing major themes in addition to the oral presentation.
- Visitability Assessment: For this assignment, students will assess how
  ‘visitable' where they live is --- is there a barrier free entry? How
  accessible are bathrooms? Are there features for hearing or sight
  disabilities? Students will turn in a written narrative assessment of
  their chosen space. Images can be included as long as they are image
  described using alt-text. [[https://visitability.org/]]
- Website Check: For this assignment, students can choose to analyze the
  accessibility of a website using [[https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/][WCAG
  2.0 guidelines]]. Students will turn in a narrative about elements in
  the webpage and an overall description of whether and who the site
  works for. 
- Interview (with transcript): Students can choose to interview someone
  about the technologies they use related to their disabilities. Your
  professor has guidelines for students who choose this option.
- Skill Development: Teach yourself some skill related to
  accessibility/inclusion (get approval and ideas from your TA or
  professor for how to assess your new skill). Could be video
  description (and then you demonstrate this by describing a 10 minute
  video and recording).
- Topic Projects (25%): Pick a technology or theme in disability culture
  and follow its history or how it is contemporarily depicted; what is
  the story of some technology or object aimed at disability? Students
  will present on these topics. Please include two dates on which you
  would be willing to present on this topic in your adventure plan. You
  are welcome to work in teams. You will have 10 minutes for
  presentation.
- Opinion/Editorial (25%): Write an Op-Ed Style article that stakes a
  position on some item of policy or politics about disability,
  technology, or health. Get approval on your topic from your TA. Op-Eds
  are fairly short (750 words), but harder to do because you have to
  argue well for some action or policy in a short space.
- ADA Survey (25%): Using the
  [[https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/smallbusiness/smallbusprimer2010.htm#:~:text=The%20ADA%20requires%20that%20small,and%20resources%20of%20a%20business.][ADA
  Small Business Guide]] and [[https://www.adachecklist.org/][ADA
  Checklist for Existing Facilities]], students will assess the
  accessibility of a location of their choice. Don't forget the
  bathrooms. Students will turn in the ADA checklist/survey and
  narrative assessment of their choice and any interesting findings.
  Images can be used, but must be described in alt-text.
- Participation (25): Yes, you can ask for a participation grade. The
  work you would do for this would be showing up to class, especially
  your class section, remaining engaged, and participating. 
- Create Your Own (25): This course has had people make comic strips,
  design objects, make *captioned* youtube videos explaining concepts
  for general audiences, review a scholarly book for an academic
  journal, and more. For Create Your Own, please propose something you'd
  like to make, write, act, build, or do, and please tell me how much of
  your grade you think it should be worth. You can do up to 2 of these
  -- as long as you get approval from your TA+prof. Or you can do a
  large one of these for 50% of your grade.

*Quizlets 25%*

The remaining 25% of your grade will be accounted for in Quizlets. These
short form quizzes with quick answer items (multiple choice and/or
true-false or things like this) and open answer questions to answer in a
few paragraphs. These will be taken outside of classtime and are not
timed, but there will be deadlines for their completion.
