From the spread of disinformation via social media, to class-biased dynamic pricing, to racial profiling in online systems that lead to “real-world” harms, teaching data ethics has never been more urgently needed in the data science curriculum.  This article conducts a thorough review of the literature on data ethics and explores current trends among syllabi on the topic.  It analyzes the overlaps and divides between various approaches to data ethics, from FAT (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency), to the Public Interest Technology movement, to calls to reimagine “digital justice” from Critical Race and Digital Studies scholars such as Ruha Benjamin, to the way classical philosophical texts on ethics from different cultural contexts are being applied to the digital age.  Besides a traditional literature review, we also present a data visualization of the relationship between different approaches to data ethics through a zettelkasten graphic, an interconnected web of literature clustered by shared concepts and cross-citations.  Finally, we propose next steps in defining a cutting-edge approach to teaching data ethics that takes into account diverse understandings of the topic within the urgency of the moment. This approach will not only familiarize students with data ethics theories, but will push them to recognize a horizon of possible solutions and build a foundation of computational literacy to explore solutions in practice.
