* Data Ethics Literature Review

This is research project to survey academic literature, courses, and other materials related to ethics in data science.

Very much a work-in-progress.

We use semantic web technologies to chart:

 - Courses in data ethics
 - Texts in data ethics
 - Relations between the above

* Goals

Goals of this research project include:

 - production of a website to display a navigable collection of courses,
 - production of a sample course syllabus

* Structure of this Repository

- ~/aoir-abstract/~: abstract for the project, for the AoIR conference.
- ~/data/~: this contains the main graph data, in [[https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/][Turtle]]-format [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework][RDF]].
- ~/notes/~: an [[https://github.com/org-roam][org-roam]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]], containing mostly hand-written notes for each source in the bibliography, and for additional concept notes, as needed.
- ~/papers~: contains PDFs of papers themselves, if available. Each paper should be named according to its bibliographic key. These may be withheld from the Git repository, for the moment.
- ~/turtleize/~: a set of Python scripts for generating the graph, manipulating the data, and visualizing it.
- ~bibliography.bib~: a BibLaTeX file containing the bibliography.

* Hacking

To run the code in this project:

1. Install the [[https://nixos.org/][Nix Package Manager]].
2. Enter the ~turtleize~ directory: ~cd turtleize~
3. Run ~nix-shell~, which will load the environment from ~default.nix~.

See [[./turtleize/README.org][the README in the turtleize/ directory for more details.]]
