* Data Ethics Literature Review

This is research project to survey academic literature, courses, and other materials related to ethics in data science.

Very much a work-in-progress.

We use semantic web technologies to chart:

 - Courses in data ethics
 - Texts in data ethics
 - Relations between the above

* Goals

Goals of this research project include:

 - production of a website to display a navigable collection of courses,
 - production of a sample course syllabus

* Structure of this Repository

- ~/aoir-abstract/~: abstract for the project, for the AoIR conference.
- ~/data/~: the main graph data, in [[https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/][Turtle]]-format [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework][RDF]].
  - ~courseAndTexts.ttl~: the main data file
  - ~courses.ttl~: a subset of the above, missing bibliographic data
  - ~texts-hq.ttl~: just a turtle version of the bibliography.bib file in the root directory
  - ~texts~: graph data for texts, organized by course. Their format is {courseID}.{extension}.
    - ~txt~: our manually-extracted references, copy-pasted from the syllabi
    - ~bib~: bibtex files generated from those .txt files, using anystyle
    - ~ttl~: turtle files generated from the bibtex files, using toRDF.py
- ~/notes/~: an [[https://github.com/org-roam][org-roam]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]], containing mostly hand-written notes for each source in the bibliography, and for additional concept notes, as needed.
- ~/papers~: contains PDFs of papers themselves, if available. Each paper should be named according to its bibliographic key. These may be withheld from the Git repository, for the moment.
- ~/turtleize/~: a set of Python scripts for generating the graph, manipulating the data, and visualizing it.
- ~bibliography.bib~: a BibLaTeX file containing a manually-collected bibliography

* Hacking

To run the code in this project:

1. Install the [[https://nixos.org/][Nix Package Manager]]. See "Installing Nix," below.
2. Enter the ~turtleize~ directory: ~cd turtleize~
3. Run ~nix-shell~, which will load the environment from ~default.nix~.

See [[./turtleize/README.org][the README in the turtleize/ directory for more details.]]

** Installing Nix

*** On MacOS
**** Option 1: install Nix directly.

1. Open the Terminal app, and run ~curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh~
2. Reboot your system.
3. Open a terminal again, and type ~nix --version~, to ensure that it worked.

**** Option 2: install NixOS via USB drive.

This will allow you to boot NixOS natively.

1. Download [[https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-20.09/latest-nixos-gnome-x86_64-linux.iso][the ISO from this link.]]
2. Copy it to a USB disk [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-booting-from-usb][using these instructions.]] Alternatively, there are [[https://www.uubyte.com/burn-iso-to-usb-on-mac.html][some tutorials, like this one]] that explain how to burn an ISO to a USB disk.
3. Boot your computer from the USB disk. This step is different for every computer, but it usually means pressing some key (F10, F2, F12, or some other key). Consult your computer's manual for how to boot from an external drive.
4. Once in NixOS, open a terminal, and type ~nix --version~ to verify that it worked.

**** Option 3: install NixOS via VirtualBox.

1. [[https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.22/VirtualBox-6.1.22-144080-OSX.dmg][Install VirtualBox using this .dmg file.]]
2. Download [[https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-20.09/latest-nixos-x86_64-linux.ova][the NixOS virtualbox appliance.]]
3. Open VirtualBox,
4. Run File → Import Appliance from the menu.
5. Select previously downloaded OVA file.
6. Click Import.
7. You can then start the virtual machine.
8. You can log in as user demo, password demo.
9. Open a terminal within the virtualbox.
10. Type ~nix --version~ to verify that it worked.

*** On Windows

**** Option 1: install Nix via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
1. Follow [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10][the instructions for installing WSL on Windows]], if you don't already have it installed.
2. Open the WSL terminal (different from the Windows command line).
3. Run ~curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh~ from within the WSL terminal.
4. Type ~nix --version~ to verify that it worked.

**** Option 2: install Nix via USB drive

1. Download [[https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-20.09/latest-nixos-gnome-x86_64-linux.iso][the ISO from this link.]]
2. Copy it to a blank USB drive using Rufus or equivalent. [[https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-burn-an-iso-file-to-a-usb-drive-2619270][Here's a tutorial for burning an ISO to a USB drive using Rufus.]]
3. Boot from the USB disk.
4. Once in NixOS, open a terminal, and type ~nix --version~ to verify that it worked.

**** Option 3: install NixOS via VirtualBox

1. [[https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.22/VirtualBox-6.1.22-144080-Win.exe][Install VirtualBox with this .exe file.]]
2. Download [[https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-20.09/latest-nixos-x86_64-linux.ova][the NixOS virtualbox appliance.]]
3. Open VirtualBox,
4. Run File → Import Appliance from the menu.
5. Select previously downloaded OVA file.
6. Click Import.
7. You can then start the virtual machine.
8. You can log in as user demo, password demo.
9. Open a terminal within the virtualbox.
10. Type ~nix --version~ to verify that it worked.
