            <h2>Welcome to Data Ethics</h2>
            <p>
On this site we map the burgeoning field of data ethics, an interdisciplinary
area of study, spanning computer science, data science, statistics, the social
sciences, and the humanities.

There is growing recognition of the importance of data ethics as a foundation of
professional practice and a pillar of education in data-driven fields.  We have
designed this roadmap as a tool for educators to explore the expanding field of
data ethics coursework and literature in the hopes that it will contribute to
new and expanded data ethics course design.

This tool was developed through a collaboration at Columbia University between
Jonathan Reeve, Isabelle Zaugg, Tian Zheng, Serena Yuan, and Zhuohan Zhang.  To
develop our tool, we used syllabi crowdsourced from Fiesler et al.’s 2017 study
and elsewhere, and created a graph database, using semantic web technologies
(linked open data, in Turtle RDF), that encodes: 1) courses related to data
ethics, 2) their assigned texts, scraped from syllabi, and 3) other texts
related to the field, and the texts they cite.  We then created a graphical
visualization, an explorer which is designed to provide insight into the
following questions relevant to educators:
</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which texts are most frequently assigned, and cited? And which texts are excluded? Are there important outliers that deserve more attention?</li>
              <li>Where are the disciplinary divides, and how can they be bridged?</li>
              <li>What are similarities and differences between data ethics courses?</li>
              <li>Which institutions, scholars, educators are innovating in this space?</li>
              <li>What are the major topic areas?</li>
            </ul>
