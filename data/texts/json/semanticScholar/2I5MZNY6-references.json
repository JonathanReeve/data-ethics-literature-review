Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively \"shut out,\" and it can take a very long time before they become popular.We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem: the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality.

This hypothesis was called \"the two-step flow of communication.\"1 The hypothesis aroused considerable interest. The authors themselves were intrigued by its implications for democratic society. It was a healthy sign, they felt, that people were still most successfully persuaded by give-andtake with other people and that the influence of the mass media was less automatic and less potent than had been assumed. For social theory, and for the design of communications research, the hypothesis suggested that the image of modern urban society needed revision.

The Political Economy of Internet Search Engines", "abstract": "This paper presents a structural analysis of the Internet search engine market. Search engines are a core element of the Internet media system, topping the Nielsen NetRatings Top 10 list of online properties in every market measured and generating advertising revenues of billions of dollars each year. Using a search engine is the most popular online activity after reading email. A political economy approach is used to identify the relevant parties in the system, their ownership, their exchanges, and the constraints to which they are subjected. The market is shown to be similar to other media markets in that it is both highly concentrated and global in scope, and funded primarily by advertising. However, there are several important differences. First, although traditional media conglomerates operate online, they do not control the most powerful actors such as Google and Yahoo!. Second, the advertising market is structured differently. Advertising is normally linked to words entered as search terms by users, and this keyword-based advertising is syndicated to other search engines, large and small, primarily by Google and Yahoo!-owned Overture, increasing their influence. Third, the situation is complicated by new commercial actors called search engine optimisation companies who operate within a grey market often in opposition to search engine companies, to strengthen the rank of their clients in search engine results. Recent studies within the computer science discipline have shown search engine results to be systematically biased in favour of commercial sites, popular sites, and US-based sites. With no public service mandate and little regulation, the study raises the question of whether the current system of search provision online serves the 'public good'.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 34, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2637998", "name": "E.

This \"rich-get-richer\" phenomenon is particularly problematic for new and high-quality pages because they may never get a chance to get users' attention, decreasing the overall quality of search results in the long run. In this paper, we propose a new ranking function, called page quality that can alleviate the problem of popularity-based ranking. We first present a formal framework to study the search engine bias by discussing what is an \"ideal\" way to measure the intrinsic quality of a page. We then compare how PageRank, the current ranking metric used by major search engines, differs from this ideal quality metric. This framework will help us investigate the search engine bias in more concrete terms and provide clear understanding why PageRank is effective in many cases and exactly when it is problematic. We then propose a practical way to estimate the intrinsic page quality to avoid the inherent bias of PageRank. We derive our proposed quality estimator through a careful analysis of a reasonable web user model, and we present experimental results that show the potential of our proposed estimator. We believe that our quality estimator has the potential to alleviate the rich-get-richer phenomenon and help new and high-quality pages get the attention that they deserve.", "venue": "SIGMOD '05", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 161, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "4658767", "name": "Junghoo Cho"}, {"authorId": "1697207", "name": "Sourashis Roy"}, {"authorId": "2075454069", "name": "Robert Adams"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "546aa4211d0af9e25fd0025f2b7722083982197b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1976708218"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/546aa4211d0af9e25fd0025f2b7722083982197b", "title": "Democracy and difference : contesting the boundaries of the political", "abstract": "Introduction: The Democratic Moment and the Problem of Difference3Pt. 1Democratic Theory: Foundations and Perspectives191Three Normative Models of Democracy212Fugitive Democracy313Using Power/Fighting Power: The Polity464Toward a Deliberative Model of Democratic Legitimacy675Procedure and Substance in Deliberative Democracy956Communication and the Other: Beyond Deliberative Democracy120Pt. 2Equality, Difference, and Public Representation1377Dealing with Difference: A Politics of Ideas, or a Politics of Presence?1398Three Forms of Group-Differentiated Citizenship in Canada1539Diversity and Democracy: Representing Differences17110Democracy, Difference, and the Right of Privacy18711Gender Equity and the Welfare State: A Postindustrial Thought Experiment218Pt. 3Culture, Identity, and Democracy24312Democracy, Power, and the \"Political\"24513Difference, Dilemmas, and the Politics of Home25714Democracy and Multiculturalism27815The Performance of Citizenship: Democracy, Gender, and Difference in the French Revolution29516Peripheral Peoples and Narrative Identities: Arendtian Reflections on Late Modernity314Pt. 4Does Democracy Need Foundations?33117Idealizations, Foundations, and Social Practices33318Democratic Theory and Democratic Experience33619Democracy, Philosophy, and Justification34020Foundationalism and Democracy348List of Contributors361Index365", "venue": "", "year": 1996, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1085, "influentialCitationCount": 35, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38572385", "name": "S.

The paper concludes that democracy is deeply rooted in Japanese history, but not in a form that is readily recognisable to Western observers. Consensus has been more significant than voting. The view that the US administration had a strong influence probably reflects policy rhetoric, not the reality in schools.

Diaries move online and suddenly they're more about creating selves than writing about them. Web sites don't have fences, yet a site for auction hunters was found to have trespassed on eBay, a metaphorical offense for which it paid a very real price. Companies invest heavily in professional, polished Web sites, but the Web rewards sites that revel in imperfection. Bits are the \"atoms\" of the Web, but they have no weight, no size and no real existence. \nThese anomalies are just a few that show how uncomfortable the fit between the Web and the real world is -- and how deeply weird the ordinary life of the Web is. In this one-of-a-kind book of social commentary, David Weinberger takes us beyond the hype, revealing what is truly revolutionary about this new medium. Just as Marshall McLuhan forever altered our view of broadcast media, Weinberger shows that the Web is transforming not only social institutions but also bedrock concepts of our world such as space, time, self, knowledge -- even reality itself. The Web would be important enough if it hooked up our species on a global scale. But, Weinberger argues, it is doing much more than that. Unlike previous technologies such as the phone or fax, the Web is a permanent public space that gathers value every time someone posts a Web page, responds on a discussion board, or replies to a mail list. More and more of our lives together are being lived in this new, second world that intersects the real world in ways we have only begun to understand. \nWeinberger introduces us to the denizens of this second world, people like Zannah, whose online diary turns self-revelation into play; Tim Bray, whose map of the Web reveals what's at the heart of the new Web space; and Danny Yee and Claudiu Popa, part of the new breed of Web experts we trust despite their lack of obvious qualifications. Through these stories of life on the Web, an insightful take on some familiar -- and some unfamiliar -- Web sites, and a pervasive sense of humor, Weinberger is the first to put the Web into the social and intellectual context we need to begin assessing its true impact on our lives. The irony, according to Weinberger, is that this seemingly weird new technology is more in tune with our authentic selves than is the modern world. Because the Web foils our conventional assumptions about concepts like space and time and self, we are led back to a more authentic view of what it means to be a person sharing a world with others -- whether it's the world of the Web or the real world of atoms. Our experience on the Web enables us to recapture the truth of our experience of the real world.

This bias generates placement revenues but creates a disutility to users, thus reducing user-based revenues. We formulate the search engine design problem as a tradeoff between these two types of revenues. We demonstrate that the optimal placement strategy depends on the relative benefits (to providers) and disutilities (to users) of paid placement. We compute the optimal placement fee, characterize the optimal bias level, and analyze sensitivity of the placement strategy to various factors. In the optimal paid placement strategy, the placement revenues are set below the monopoly level due to its negative impact on advertising revenues. An increase in the search engine's quality of service allows it to improve profits from paid placement, moving it closer to the ideal. However, an increase in the value-per-user motivates the gatekeeper to increase market share by reducing further its reliance on paid placement and fraction of paying providers.", "venue": "WWW '02", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 18, "citationCount": 46, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2832986", "name": "H.

Yet this image is highly problematic. Nowhere in the original 1872 Act does the term \u2018free speech\u2019 appear. In this article it is argued that this enigma is in fact perfectly understandable for two reasons. First, the sign \u2018speech\u2019 had carved out a distinct geographical and moral space in Hyde Park over a century before 1872. Constituted through the \u2018last dying speeches\u2019 of the criminal class of 18th-century London, this subaltern rationality rendered visible the class character of law by disrupting the distancing of legal discourse from governance. Secondly, by undertaking a genealogical investigation of the sign \u2018speech\u2019 at Hyde Park, the traces left by scaffold culture were re-combined to slowly translate \u2018last dying speeches\u2019 into a more overtly political proletarian public sphere. The political mediation of the sign \u2018speech\u2019 meant that the state had to respond to this sign by overcoming the failures of Tyburn and impose a successful mode of governance at Hyde Park.

By setting out the terms of democracy in a fresh and systematic way, Michael Saward provides compelling responses to many troubling questions in democratic theory. In a tightly--argued analysis, the book offers innovative accounts of the value of democracy, the links between direct and representative institutions, the question of political community, and trade--offs between democracy and competing values. Building on a justification for democracy which embraces scepticism, Saward argues that democracy means the responsiveness of government to citizensa wishes. He shows why direct democracy and an array of constitutionally guaranteed rights are crucial to democracy. A comprehensive framework for analysing trade--offs of democracy illuminates the interplay between democratic idealism and political realism. The discussion of political community cuts through conventional pessimism to show how democrats can respond positively to sub--group demands for autonomy.

This paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and economic perspective to the search engine market. \nThe findings indicate that (1) despite an increasing number of search engines, barriers to entry seem high, largely due to the exponential growth in the number of web sites and the non-scalability of the current search technology and collective switching costs; (2) older search engine sites tend typically to have more features to lock in users. Using standard economic indicators (CR4=58% and HHI=1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by anticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in this paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern. \nBased on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other possible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some search engines keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The trend shows that some search engines may dominate the search engine market. We suggest conducting research in the coverage performance of search engines and investigate \"information search cost\" as a performance indicator of search techniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive conduct (e.g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer welfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the search engine market is a particularly powerful approach for E-Commerce.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2291926", "name": "Tair-Rong Sheu"}, {"authorId": "1702030", "name": "Kathleen M.

James S. Fishkin here suggests an innovative solution to the problem of inadequate deliberation, in particular within our presidential nomination system. His reform involves a well-publicized national caucus in which a representative sample of American citizens would interact directly with presidential contenders in order to reflect and vote on the issues and candidates. In adapting democracy to the large scale nation state, says Fishkin, Americans have previously had two choices. They could participate directly through primaries and referenda or they could depend on elite groups-such as party conventions and legislatures-to represent them. The first choice offers political equality but little chance for deliberation; the second offers the participants an opportunity to deliberate but provides less political equality for the electorate. The national caucus that Fishkin proposes-an example of what he calls a \"deliberative opinion poll\"-combines deliberation with political equality and reveals what the public would think if it had better conditions and information with which to explore and define the issues with the candidates. Arguing persuasively for the usefulness of deliberative opinion polls, Fishkin places them within the history of democratic theory and practice, exploring models of democracy ranging form ancient Athens and the debates of the American founders to contemporary transitions toward democracy in Eastern Europe.", "venue": "", "year": 1991, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1040, "influentialCitationCount": 38, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46235445", "name": "S.

We conducted a study to see how effective eight search engines are.

We calculated traditional information retrieval measures of recall and precision at varying numbers of retrieved documents and used these as the bases for statistical comparisons of retrieval effectiveness among the eight search engines. We also calculated the likelihood that a document retrieved by one search engine was retrieved by other search engines as well.", "venue": "Inf. Process.

The World Wide Web is already a powerful influence on the public's access to government documents, the tactics and content of political campaigns, the behavior of voters, the efforts of activists to circulate their messages, and the ways in which topics enter the public discourse. The essays collected here capture the richness of current discourse about democracy and cyberspace. Some contributors offer front-line perspectives on the impact of emerging technologies on politics, journalism, and civic experience. What happens, for example, when we increase access to information or expand the arena of free speech? Other contributors place our shifting understanding of citizenship in historical context, suggesting that notions of cyber-democracy and online community must grow out of older models of civic life. Still others consider the global flow of information and test our American conceptions of cyber-democracy against developments in other parts of the world. How, for example, do new media operate in Castro's Cuba, in post-apartheid South Africa, and in the context of multicultural debates on the Pacific Rim? For some contributors, the new technologies endanger our political culture; for others, they promise civic renewal.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 119, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "143946024", "name": "Henry Jenkins"}, {"authorId": "2073544717", "name": "D.

Problems in the development of a generalisable information retrieval theory from informa tion retrieval experiment and the associated mathematical mod elling is examined. The source of these problems is traced back to assumptions underlying information retrieval research, and to the nature of the relationship between the theoretical frame work of information retrieval research and the nature of the problems on which this framework is brought to bear. Particu lar attention is directed to problems in measurement, in estab lishing a significant relationship between test results and results from operational evaluations, and in establishing a connection between the situational and behavioural assumptions employed in information retrieval research and real situations and be haviour. The attempt to develop information retrieval research as an experimental science akin to natural science or engineering, around the notion of the quantification of relevance is miscon ceived. In order for information retrieval research to break out of the limitations of its present theoretical framework, and of the backwater to which that framework has led, a reorientation is required. The argument of this paper is that information retrieval research needs to be reoriented from a focus on the information retrieval system and on supposed 'systemic' factors to an orientation to the user and the user's interaction with information sources.", "venue": "", "year": 1984, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 61, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46754669", "name": "D.
