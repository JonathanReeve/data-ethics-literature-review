In the \u2018engineered society,\u2019 an ethos of rationalization is seen in the application of means to ends. The events of 11 September 2001, and the war on terror have brought increased attention to the question, but the increased use of technical means for control reflects continuity rather than disjuncture. Six social control strategies are discussed and illustrated: target removal, target devaluation, target insulation, offender incapacitation, offender exclusion, and identification of offenses and offenders. In complex settings in a democratic society, relying primarily on technology to control human behavior has clear social and ethical limitations.", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "21441437", "name": "G.
