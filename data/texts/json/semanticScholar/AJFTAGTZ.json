Since its establishment, more than 500,000 people filed requests with Google to be \u2018de-listed\u2019 from its search. At the same time, the Court\u2019s decision has stirred debates focused on the tension the decision raised between a person\u2019s right to privacy and freedom of expression. This study offers, yet, a different reading of the decision and its meaning. It first outlines the theoretical foundations of the concept of memory and its relation to rights. Then, it focuses on media, memory, and the RtbF. Afterward, the study discusses the legal origins of the RtbF and claims that the right is actually a right to construct one\u2019s narrative. Therefore, in order to analyze the RtbF, this study places it within memory studies and analyzes it through its tools. From this perspective, this study criticizes the emphasis placed on forgetting in the definition of the right and problematizes its focus on individuals. Eventually, this study uses the legitimization the RtbF gives to a new discourse about memory in relation to rights in order to suggest an extended \u2018right to memory\u2019 that will answer the memory needs of our time.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount": 19, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2294147", "name": "Noam Tirosh"}]}
