We address this question by focusing on the Netflix Prize (2006\u20132009), a contest offering US$1m to the first individual or team to boost the accuracy of the company\u2019s existing movie recommendation system by 10%. Although billed as a technical challenge intended for engineers, we argue that the Netflix Prize was equally an effort to reinterpret the meaning of culture in ways that overlapped with, but also diverged in important respects from, the three dominant senses of the term assayed by Raymond Williams. Thus, this essay explores the conceptual and semantic work required to render algorithmic information processing systems legible as forms of cultural decision making. It also then represents an effort to add depth and dimension to the concept of \u201calgorithmic culture.\u201d", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 107, "citationCount": 282, "influentialCitationCount": 12, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "30757117", "name": "Blake Hallinan"}, {"authorId": "97473757", "name": "Ted Striphas"}]}
