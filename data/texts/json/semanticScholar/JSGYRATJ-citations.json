Experts have advocated for libraries to educate the public to resist misinformation, yet libraries cannot assume sole responsibility for information literacy work. In this chapter, the authors explore several successful information literacy programs in Ukraine, whose fake news problems made global headlines in 2014, when the Russian annexation of Crimea was accompanied by a flood of crude but effective disinformation. The authors look particularly at the Learn to Discern programs established by the international non\u2010profit organization IREX to foster information literacy using techniques grounded in interdisciplinary expertise and carefully evaluated through pilot studies and follow\u2010up evaluations. These programs train instructors through workshops and provide them with materials. In the first program, aimed at the general public, many of the instructors were librarians, and library facilities were heavily used to deliver the public training. In the second program, information literacy was integrated into the public school curriculum and thousands of teachers were trained to deliver expertly designed materials for particular grade levels and subjects. The authors also consider the special challenges posed by the COVID\u201019 pandemic, both as a source for new forms of misinformation and as a disruptor of training previously delivered in tightly packed libraries and classrooms. These Ukrainian programs demonstrate the potential for fighting fake news and other misinformation on a scale far beyond what could be accomplished by individual libraries acting alone. \u00a9 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited s of reproduction in any form reserved.", "venue": "Advances in Librarianship", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47367437", "name": "M.

The major findings include the following: 1) in the librarians' guides stating their definition of fake news, the two elements of falsity and the intention to mislead were explicitly stated. The other element of bias, however, was presented in only some guides. 2) The sub-elements of clickbait, a decontextualized content and omitted information were inconsistently or barely presented across these guides. 3) Only two institutional libraries put forth the notion of fact in relation to fake news in their guides. 4) All of the guides suggested checklist approaches to detecting fake news or evaluating news sources. Finally, 5) librarians acknowledge the influence of human biases on consuming news. However, psychological factors are minimally presented in most of the guides. This study provides a few suggestions. First, librarians must further clarify the term fake news so that it reflects its multiple layers. Second, librarians must incorporate new strategies, such as lateral reading and click restraints, in combination with a few prioritized elements of a checklist into their guides regarding detecting fake news. Finally, librarians must pay attention to psychological factors more when interpreting facts in their strategies about news sources and fake news.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145538717", "name": "Sook Lim"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "c6444a95d0abf31765471cf9b3fdc01db55b84e3", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/jolis/Hinnant20", "MAG": "3034146088", "DOI": "10.1177/0961000620927834"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6444a95d0abf31765471cf9b3fdc01db55b84e3", "title": "Book review: Johan Farkas and Jannick Schou, Post-truth, fake news, and democracy: Mapping the politics of falsehood", "abstract": null, "venue": "J.

This article maps out a research agenda that researchers and public library practitioners can use to make libraries more effective sites for combatting misinformation. This research agenda is grounded in analysis of interviews and workshop discussions of public library staff from Washington State. This analysis reveals three areas in which academic partners can support public libraries: through the design of effective programming, through the development of tools that help librarians keep up-to-date on relevant misinformation, and through interventions in the political and economic contexts that hamper the freedom of librarians to engage controversial topics.

Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but not by library institutions. An unsuccessful follow-up (n\u202f=\u202f600) suggests that the effectiveness of the correction is season dependent and opens the possibility that libraries may yet play a role, but not necessarily because they are trusted.

Although there are many potential benefits of crowdsourcing, the quality control of crowd contributions stands out as one of the most significant challenges. Crowds can create the information contents but at the same time can facilitate information disorder: misinformation, disinformation and mal-information. Crowd created information is a dominant element in what is sometimes called the post-truth era. A small piece of misleading information can constitute significant challenges to the information sharing group or society. This misinformation can reshape in various ways how information-driven communities make sense of their world. As information disorder and its effects have recently started to be recognised as a potential problem in IS research, we need to explore this phenomenon in more detail, to understand how it happens and why. This multiple case study is aimed at appraising information disorder through crowd-created contents in the knowledge and cultural heritage organisations such as Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM).

Although corporate disinformation techniques perfected by the tobacco industry in the 1950\u2019s were exposed, instead of disappearing they have only grown more influential with the rise of the internet. Many industries from petroleum to pharmaceuticals use scientific research to promote their corporate message and have contributed to harming the public. Users need information literacy (IL) to provide them with the skills they need to critically evaluate information and reject the techniques of disinformation. This essay will argue that librarians should provide instruction about conflict of interest (COI) while instructing users in evaluation, and that the Framework for Information Literacy (2016) can provide a structure for this instruction. Libraries can help their patrons exercise critical skepticism when evaluating information to avoid becoming disinformed.
