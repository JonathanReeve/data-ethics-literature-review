Affected patients typically die by the time they enter their teens. Medications exist that can ease symptoms, but there are currently no drug treatments approved specifically for this disease. So, there was excitement when a team led by Leslie Gordon, a pediatrician at Brown University\u2019s Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island, reported that an experimental drug called lonafarnib\u2014first developed for treating cancer in 1990s but later abandoned after it failed in that setting\u2014might buy some time for children with progeria. \u201cWe learned for the first time that progeria can be improved,\u201d says Gordon, who cofounded the Progeria Research Foundation in 1999 after her son Sam was born with the disease. In a two-year, open-label trial involving 25 affected children, lonafarnib offered slight but statistically significant improvements in bone density, vascular stiffness and other disease symptoms1. The findings, published last year, have since buoyed the small but active progeria community. And the results have potentially wider implications for researchers studying the much larger field of \u2018normal\u2019 aging in the elderly, too. \u201cWith the discovery of the genetic defect [behind progeria] and the opportunity to understand exactly what goes on, it has now become quite clear at the molecular level that this is an interesting model of aging,\u201d Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, told Nature Medicine. Ten years ago, Collins led the team that first demonstrated the cause of progeria: mutations in the gene encoding lamin A, an important structural component in the membrane that lines the cell nucleus2. Of note, mutated lamin A protein (known as progerin) also accumulates in the cells of elderly people without progeria, albeit at much lower levels and with a slower buildup3. Thus, some researchers expect that efforts aimed at finding therapies to treat progeria\u2014a disease that affects just one in 8 million newborns\u2014 could serve as test bed for drug development to prevent normal aging, a problem that affects almost everybody. \u201cAt the cellular level, progeria and normal aging are remarkably similar,\u201d says Tom Misteli, a cell biologist at the NIH\u2019s National Cancer Institute. \u201cWe have found our animal models of [progeria] to be very useful investigating different questions relevant for normal aging, but at an accelerated pace, which makes the work Drug development for progeria yields insights into normal aging", "venue": "Nature Medicine", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 8200, "influentialCitationCount": 860, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "143799663", "name": "Kevin Jiang"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "07ec9d3e2d84093810ed62a3d59cfdb7497754cd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1994772518", "DOI": "10.1504/IJASS.2007.015585"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07ec9d3e2d84093810ed62a3d59cfdb7497754cd", "title": "Harnessing collective wisdom at a fraction of the time using Structured Dialogic Design Process in a virtual communication context", "abstract": "The Structured Dialogic Design Process (SDDP) is applied in the context of a rich web-based communication environment.

In Networks and States, Milton Mueller counters this, showing how Internet governance poses novel and fascinating governance issues that give rise to a global politics and new transnational institutions. Drawing on theories of networked governance, Mueller provides a broad overview of Internet governance from the formation of ICANN to the clash at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the formation of the Internet Governance Forum, the global assault on peer-to-peer file sharing and the rise of national-level Internet control and security concerns. Mueller identifies four areas of conflict and coordination that are generating a global politics of Internet governance: intellectual property, cyber-security, content regulation, and the control of critical Internet resources (domain names and IP addresses). He investigates how recent theories about networked governance and peer production can be applied to the Internet, offers case studies that illustrate the Internet's unique governance problems, and charts the historical evolution of global Internet governance institutions, including the formation of a transnational policy network around the WSIS.

This generously illustrated book tells the story of the human family, showing how our species' physical traits and behaviours evolved over millions of years as our ancestors adapted to dramatic environmental changes. In \"What Does It Mean To Be Human?\", Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian's Human Origins Program, and Christopher Sloan, National Geographic's paleoanthropology expert, delve into our distant past to explain when, why, and how we acquired the unique biological and cultural qualities that govern our most fundamental connections and interactions with other people and with the natural world. Drawing on the latest research, they conclude that we are the last survivors of a once-diverse family, and that our evolution was shaped by one of the most unstable eras in Earth's environmental history. The book presents a wealth of attractive new material especially developed for the hall's displays, from life-like reconstructions of our ancestors sculpted by the acclaimed artist John Gurche to photographs from National Geographic and Smithsonian archives, along with informative graphics and illustrations.

To explain this we discriminate between three objectives, often implied in the literature on technological neutrality of law. The first we call the compensation objective, which refers to the need to have technology specific law in place whenever specific technological designs threated the substance of human rights. The second we call the innovation objective, referring to the need to prevent legal rules from privileging or discriminating specific technological designs in ways that would stifle innovation. The third we call the sustainability objective, which refers to the need to enact legislation at the right level of abstraction, to prevent the law from becoming out of date all too soon. The argument that technology neutral law requires compensation in the form of technology specific law is built on a relational conception of technology, and we explain that though technology in itself is neither good nor bad, it is never neutral. We illustrate the relevance of the three objectives with a discussion of the EU cookie Directive of 2009. Finally we explain the salience of the legal obligation of Data Protection by Design in the proposed General Data Protection Regulation and test this against the compensation, innovation and sustainability objectives.", "venue": "Comput.

This is a rather technical question. In our everyday interactions, however, we do raise a number of personal identity questions that are quite distinct from it. In order to explore the variety of ways in which the Internet may affect personal identity, I propose in this study to broaden the typical philosophical horizon to other more mundane senses of the question. In Section\u00a02, I describe a number of possible meanings of personal identity observed in everyday contexts and more philosophical ones. With some caveats, I argue that it is the specific context in which the question arises that disambiguates the meaning of the question. Online contexts are novel and peculiar insofar as they afford prolonged disembodied and anonymous interaction with others. In line with our previous conclusion, then, there is reason to suspect that such contexts generate new and sui generis answers to the personal identity question. In Section\u00a03, I examine this question and, contrary to expectations, largely dispel this suspicion.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nobel laureate Richard Thaler and legal scholar and bestselling author Cass Sunstein explain in this important exploration of choice architecture that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself. In Nudge, Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think, we can design choice environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful \"choice architecture\" can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of choice.

Examining profound social changes during the three decades of the post-Mao reforms, the article reveals a number of similarities with the individualization process in Western Europe but also demonstrates some important differences.

The main idea is that democratic societies are dependent on toleration of a plurality of publics, and simultaneously there is a need for communication between the different publics. The ethos underlying this assumption is that democracy requires a transcendence of subjective conditions in order for the public(s) to gain legitimacy and recognition of opinions. Validity of opinions presupposes a public aspect that is available through communication. More specifically, the validity in question is obtained through its claim on universality \u2013 i.e. the transcendence of purely private subjective conditions. This kind of validity is found in reflective judgment or enlarged thinking, as displayed in Kant\u2019s third critique.

There is a broad consensus among philosophers of science that evolutionary psychology is a deeply flawed enterprise. For philosophers of mind and cognitive science evolutionary psychology has been a source of empirical hypotheses about cognitive architecture and specific components of that architecture.

What did it take to write Big Data? A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for The Economist, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book Delete had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted Big Data to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read. Q. Are you big datas cheerleaders? A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big datas likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it. Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise? A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing peoples everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere. Q. Is Big Data then primarily a story about economic efficiency? A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but thats only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal changefrom urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life. Q. So big data offers only upside? A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book the dark side of big data. However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by propensity -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the fetishization of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations. Q. What can we do about this dark side? A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big datas risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues.

It could also be claimed that most people interested in the field have a good grasp of what is entailed, and this is probably correct. But, as the field grows and there is a need to carry governments and public opinion along, it is probably worth having a simple explanation of regenerative medicine. And, it is simplicity that is the nub of the matter. There are already a lot of definitions [1\u20133] but all are lengthy and not the sort of thing scientists, start-ups or advocates can say succinctly when a pharma executive, government minister or member of the public asks for clarification. Here, we address this and the origins and relationships that help to define the field. One of the complications is that regenerative medicine has grown out of a good deal of prior activity. This includes surgery, surgical implants, such as artificial hips, and increasingly sophisticated biomaterial scaffolds. It also draws on hospital procedures such as bone marrow and organ transplants and it relates to tissue engineering. There is no absolute cut-off in the transformation of these into fully developed regenerative medicine but they each leave residues of their input that can mean the patient is not capable of being termed \u2018of natural health\u2019 with respect to the treated condition. Organ transplants often demand immune-suppressing drugs and metal hips can become loose with time, engineered tissue scaffolds can provoke inflammation and bone marrow sources are variable mixtures that also can be contaminated quite easily by the nature of the cell aspiration procedure.

The ubiquitous puns on \u201cmatter\u201d do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them.

Discourse matters. Culture matters. There is an important sense in which the only thing that does not seem to matter anymore is matter. What compels the belief that we have a direct access to cultural representations and their content that we lack toward the things represented? How did language come to be more trustworthy than matter? Why are language and culture granted their own agency and historicity while matter is figured as passive and immutable, or at best inherits a potential for change derivatively from language and culture?

A Case Study of the Blogging Self", "abstract": "The article provides an instructive in-depth analysis of communicative practices in the personal blog. Its aim is to document the discursive dynamics and interactional ethics of blogging, with a specific focus on negotiations of the blogging self in-between public and private. Based on key findings from an empirical case study of personal blogs, the article addresses the negotiation of the blogging self from three interdependent perspectives: the network structures, patterns of interaction, and thematic orientations of the blog. Instead of approaching the online self as the individual blogger\u2019s self-presentation to an often unknown and unfamiliar audience, I analyse and discuss the \u2018blogging self\u2019 as a relational and collaborative accomplishment, as something that is constantly subject to negotiation between author and readers, and is framed by the blog as a communicative genre. The theoretical foundation for this relational approach to the self is inspired by the work of sociologist Georg Simmel on how individuals attune to their networks of affiliation in a process of socialisation (Simmel 1955). The article contributes to the discussion of ethical behaviour and privacy protection in social media by highlighting the role of phatic communication in the blog. Specifically, I demonstrate how participants in the blog network negotiate and maintain an ethos of privacy protection in and through practices associated with the phatic. They do this by adhering to a \u2018principle of sociability\u2019, allowing them to experience their communication as personal but not private.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 20, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1834033", "name": "Stine Lomborg"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "3b7007a0e185da89a3117f4674dd32f16857a093", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2333893391", "DOI": "10.2307/415932"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b7007a0e185da89a3117f4674dd32f16857a093", "title": "Relevance: Communication and Cognition", "abstract": "Preface to Second Edition.

At first glance, that level of participation --largely spurred by war in Iraq and a burgeoning culture war at home --might look like vindication of democracy. If the recent past is any indication, however, too many Americans will soon return to apathy and inactivity. Clearly, all is not well in our civic life. Citizens are participating in public affairs too infrequently, too unequally, and in too few venues to develop and sustain a robust democracy. This important new book explores the problem of America's decreasing involvement in its own affairs. Democracy at Risk reveals the dangers of civic disengagement for the future of representative democracy. The authors, all eminent scholars, undertake three main tasks: documenting recent trends in civic engagement, exploring the influence that the design of political institutions and public policies have had on those trends, and recommending steps that will increase the amount and quality of civic engagement in America. The authors focus their attention on three key areas: the electoral process, including elections and the way people get involved; the impact of location, including demographic shifts and changing development patterns; and the critical role of nonprofit organizations and voluntary associations, including the philanthropy that help keep them going. This important project, initially sponsored by the American Political Science Association, tests the proposition that social science has useful insights on the state of our democratic life. Most importantly, it charts a course for reinvigorating civic participation in the world's oldest democracy.

By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it.

In brilliant dialogue with Adorno, Levinas, Foucault, and other thinkers, she eloquently argues the limits, possibilities, and dangers of contemporary ethical thought.Butler offers a critique of the moral self, arguing that the transparent, rational, and continuous ethical subject is an impossible construct that seeks to deny the specificity of what it is to be human. We can know ourselves only incompletely, and only in relation to a broader social world that has always preceded us and already shaped us in ways we cannot grasp. If inevitably we are partially opaque to ourselves, how can giving an account of ourselves define the ethical act? And doesn't an ethical system that holds us impossibly accountable for full self-knowledge and self-consistency inflict a kind of psychic violence, leading to a culture of self-beratement and cruelty? How does the turn to social theory offer us a chance to understand the specifically social character of our own unknowingness about ourselves?In this invaluable book, by recasting ethics as a project in which being ethical means becoming critical of norms under which we are asked to act, but which we can never fully choose, Butler illuminates what it means for us as fallible creaturesto create and share an ethics of vulnerability, humility, and ethical responsiveness.

I argue that trust and knowledge are fundamentally entangled in our epistemic practices. Yet despite this fundamental entanglement, we do not trust blindly. Instead we make use of knowledge to rationally place or withdraw trust. We use knowledge about the sources of epistemic content as well as general background knowledge to assess epistemic claims. Hence, although we may have a default to trust, we remain and should remain epistemically vigilant; we look out and need to look out for signs of insincerity and dishonesty in our attempts to know. A fundamental requirement for such vigilance is transparency: in order to critically assess epistemic agents, content and processes, we need to be able to access and address them. On the Web, this request for transparency becomes particularly pressing if (a) trust is placed in unknown human epistemic agents and (b) if it is placed in non-human agents, such as algorithms. I give examples of the entanglement between knowledge and trust on the Web and draw conclusions about the forms of transparency needed in such systems to support epistemically vigilant behaviour, which empowers users to become responsible and accountable knowers.", "venue": "Ethics and Information Technology", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 46, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "17736848", "name": "Judith Simon"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "4f71e48f63d020f99c912ee97e2de6a38d73b184", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2151219288", "DBLP": "journals/tis/Bakardjieva09", "DOI": "10.1080/01972240802701627"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f71e48f63d020f99c912ee97e2de6a38d73b184", "title": "Subactivism: Lifeworld and Politics in the Age of the Internet", "abstract": "The potential of the Internet to enhance civic participation has been examined in numerous theoretical and empirical studies. This article concentrates specifically on the role the medium plays in affording and supporting new forms of making sense of public issues and getting involved in civic activities that evolve at the level of everyday life. Characteristically, these forms do not square neatly with elevated notions of political and civic participation. Their significance easily escapes recognition. Building on existing conceptualizations such as those of \u201clife politics\u201d (Giddens, 1991),\u201csub-politics\u201d (Beck, 1997) and \u201cthe political\u201d Mouffe (2005), and \u201cdemocratic rationalization\u201d (Feenberg, 1999), the concept of subactivism is proposed with the objective to expand received notions of what does and should count as civic engagement.", "venue": "Inf.
