In order to do this, the theoretical path is presented that the author and his colleagues followed, with the aim of using some concepts and theoretical and methodological approaches taken from social sciences for a better consideration of society and materials issues. The gender/materials connection does not appear to have been dealt with yet in a systematic way, although there are some interesting studies and insights. This connection instead appears very important in the light of a sociological reflection focusing on the relations among the social actors involved in the cycle of materials. The centrality of social actors within the processes that define the value chain and life cycle of products and materials is presented and, in this framework, the importance of design is stressed, together with other typical phenomena highlighted within social sciences such as closure or negotiation, power relations, etc. Particularly, considerations on gender appear important because they imply the possibility to include the different points of view, approaches and solutions of gender-diverse actors. Gender differences and gender related dynamics emerges as relevant in the definition of research priorities, in the analysis of needs, uses, and social and environmental impacts of materials and products is likely to limit the potential and distort the perspective of materials science. In this framework, existing data are presented that show that materials represent an area of scientific research (both academic and non-academic) where the under-representation of women is presently recorded and probably impacts on the materials sector as a whole. The proposed reflection on the relation between gender and materials is still a very initial one, but further research is advisable in light of the centrality of sustainable policy issues such as the Circular Economy (CE) where it is important to focus the attention on the role of social actors in the entire product cycle and not only in its final part (e.g., the purchase of consumer goods, their use, disposal, re-use, etc.).

Even though certain characteristics of robots such as identity could be effective at generating a sense of presence, this risks yielding a distortion of presence in the remote sender.

The 60 participants in this study engaged in a video call with a remote sender using either a telepresence robot with high identity or a telepresence robot with low identity. The results showed that participants felt more remote sender presence when interacting with the telepresence robot with low identity than they did with the one with high identity. On the other hand, when a telepresence robot has high identity, participants felt more presence toward the robot than they did toward the one with low identity. In the second study (N\u00a0=\u00a072), participants experienced two types of telepresence robots (identity level: a telepresence robot with high identity vs. a telepresence robot with low identity) with two types of remote senders (number of remote senders: single remote sender vs. multiple remote senders).

Recognising children as competent \u2018agents in their own right\u2019, a dynamic participatory approach was used to reach the intricacies of the relationships between the participants (a total of 41, mostly girls and aged 10-12) and digital and online technologies in late modernity.

Their ICT use is driven by the desire to and connections and entertainment, and it offers three insights for broadly utilitarian ICT for development (ICTD) projects: arst, rural users who are thought to be beyond the reach of ICTs because of their age or educational level and who do not see themselves as ICT users may nonetheless begin to use ICTs after observing other people going online and identifying activities that relate to their own lives and interests. Second, they have time to agure out how to incorporate ICTs into environments that are extremely different in terms of economy, social structures, and habits from the urban environments where ICTs originate. Finally, ICT uses that emerge from family-based practices rather than from hetero-directed programs can provide insights into the priorities or social practices of seemingly marginalized populations who have otherwise been overlooked. Introduction: ICT for What? On a hot July morning in 2010, in a small village in the Chinese northern province of Hebei, I was sitting on a pile of bricks by the side of the road, waiting for a potential interviewee to return from the aelds and show me her laptop, at the time still an expensive and rare device in the countryside. While waiting, I chatted with three older women sitting along the wall, taking a rest from their morning\u2019s activities. They seemed unlikely Internet users, especially the two oldest, Mrs. Ouyang in her late 50s and Mrs. Kong in her late 70s. To pass the time I asked what I was asking everyone in the village: Do you have a mobile phone or a computer? Only the youngest, Mrs. Tao, then in her late 40s, answered that she had a mobile phone, but said she could only use it with her daughter\u2019s help. This aligned with what I had expected to hear in terms of Internet and mobile phone use in rural China. Before starting my aeldwork, I had been reading the China Internet Network Information Center\u2019s quarterly reports on Internet use in the country, which showed consistently that use was concentrated in urban areas and among younger people and that rural use was lagging because of cost, lack of access, and lack of understanding of the Internet\u2019s potential (25th Statistical Survey, 2010). As the conversation continued, however, an entirely different picture emerged. All three women had computers in their homes. The computers belonged to their children, but a combination of watching them go online and hearing about the Internet in family discussions and in daily outdoor gatherings of neighbors had made the women aware of the Internet and of some of the things one could do online. Only Mrs. Kong maintained that she had never seen or used a computer, which again seemed reasonable to me. But she also turned out to have used QQ Video, a program similar to Skype, to chat with her son and grandchild who lived away from the village. She was not entirely aware of how QQ worked, and it was Mrs. Ouyang who said, \u201cOf course you\u2019ve used video-calls. Don\u2019t you remember? It\u2019s just like television, except there was your grandson on the screen!\u201d These older women, like most people in the village, have children and other relatives who are rural-tourban migrants, that is, residents who move from the country for shorter or longer periods to urban areas to work in factories or in the service sector, fuelling the impressive economic growth that has characterized China 19 To cite this article: Oreglia, E.

While contributing to the economic progress of the country as a whole, this migration has also increased the gap that has historically existed between urban and rural areas in terms of economic, employment, and educational opportunities; infrastructure development; and the availability of social and welfare services. In recent years, the Internet and new information and communication technologies (ICTs), and in particular, mobile phones, have started to play an important role in efforts to bridge this gap, both through government policies and initiatives and at a grassroots level as migrants bring ICTs and know-how from cities to villages. At the public level, much emphasis has been placed on the role of ICTs in rural economic development, as illustrated by this quote from an inouential World Bank report on rural informatization in China, written in collaboration with the Chinese government and, in particular, with the Advisory Committee for State Information in China: Rural populations have dramatically increased their demand for new technologies, policies, and market information, and obtaining useful information in a timely manner has become critical to the rural economy and society. With the arrival of the information age, the market economy in rural areas has been growing, and competition in the expanding economy necessitates access to information\u2014especially in agriculture, which is particularly reliant on information. ICT is being perceived as an effective tool for disseminating information resources widely and cost effectively. (Qiang, 2009, p. 1) Despite this emphasis, and backed by substantial investments in infrastructure, software, and information networks of various types, rural ICT uses still consist mainly of entertainment and communication, such as watching TV online, playing games, and staying in touch with relatives and friends who have migrated. In China, as in many other countries, Internet use is often perceived as driven by entertainment\u2014and the spectacular success of online gaming, social networking, and video and music websites indicates there is some truth to this perception. In the latest report on the Internet in China, the categories of communication (especially instant messaging) and entertainment still comprise the majority of Internet use, despite a marked increase in commerce and business use (33rd Statistical Report, 2014). In recent years, an awareness has grown that part of the problem in the countryside is the lack of locally relevant content and interfaces that are difacult to negotiate for people with little education. The solution is seen to be at the supply side, i.e., in the production of easier interfaces and more appropriate content (33rd Statistical Report, 2014). In this article, however, I argue that the preponderance of entertainmentand communication-based ICT uses are an essential component of the developmental role that new media can play among rural residents. Combined with the essential role of personal networks that introduce and mediate such technology use (e.g., the children of the three women described above), the initial focus on \u201cfun\u201d activities that create familiarity with the technology and help people stay in touch with their families are essential in keeping people \u201cin the loop\u201d who might be otherwise left out and that allow people the space, time, and support to integrate ICTs into their lives. How might one argue that the use of ICTs for leisure in emerging countries (Arora & Rangaswamy, 2013) contributes to creating development opportunities and should not be considered as outside the scope of ICTD projects? Drawing from my ethnographic aeldwork, I see the study of leisure-driven ICT uses as an important vector for understanding aspects of ICT uses that can add value when integrated into ICTD (ICT and/for development) interventions. For my research participants, the value of digital leisure \u201cfor development\u201d is three-fold. First, it allows people who do not think of themselves as ICT users and who are not considered by others as able to become proacient users to acquaint themselves with ICT devices and and uses that are meaningful for them\u2014in other words, to start imagining themselves as users. Second, the time dedicated to play is time invested in slowly negotiating and accommodating into one\u2019s daily rhythms tools and ways of communicating that represent a dramatic shift from traditional modes of interacting and exchanging information. Finally, a close observation of ICTs for leisure can provide insights into user priorities and needs, in particular as far as communication needs are concerned. In this article, I trace a social chronicle of mobile phones (and occasionally, computers) as they are adopted and adapted at the margins of Chinese society. By looking at how they at into people\u2019s lives from these three perspectives, I consider some of their effects on social ties and personal well-being to gain a more holistic view of ICTs\u2019 roles among people \u201cat the margins\u201d who are the main concern of the ICTD community. In the rest of the article, I analyze all three areas in more detail: I begin with a short introduction to 20 Information Technologies & International Development ICT AND (PERSONAL) DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL CHINA", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1686374", "name": "Elisa Oreglia"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "ca0084649d3742318e5a6a16ac89be1c43659040", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2101215734", "DOI": "10.1051/MATTECH/2014020"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca0084649d3742318e5a6a16ac89be1c43659040", "title": "Hidden societal implications of materials. Updating the awareness on what is at stake", "abstract": "In a sociological perspective, materials are to be viewed as the focus of social relations. Actually, materials are activated by and even created within social relation systems and in turn they create and activate new social relation systems connected to i.e. their extraction, production, use, management, reuse, recycling and disposal. On the basis of various European research projects carried out by the authors, the paper will be aimed at analyzing such social relations in the framework of the innovation cycle which necessarily involves a large number of societal actors, including research institutions, technological developers, industries, financial institutions, political players, civil society organizations, professional groups and local communities. Since from beginning of the innovation cycle, two sets of societal relations can be identified. The first set can be referred to as the societal technological process. Any product and material, to be discovered or imagined and then developed, produced, marketed and managed, necessarily required the creation and development of social practices and interactions closely intertwined with the scientific and technological activities. In this sense, any product and material are the result of a socio-technical system, in which the boundaries between the social dimension and the technological dimension are blurred. The second set can be called the societal political process. This includes all dynamics of a political nature (local, national, transnational) connected with a product and material, such decision-making, adoption of standards, fund raising and management, or power relations between political and administrative levels. Both this components are necessary. In fact, they are the upstream factors allowing a material to actually exist in social, economic and technological terms (otherwise they should remain an inactive and unexploitable physical matter) and often in physical terms (in that case materials simply should not even exist at all). Taking into consideration such upstream dynamics allows to perceive under a different perspective the same nature and features of the life cycle of a material and product as well as to go beyond the presently adopted social life cycle assessment practices. As for the downstream aspects, they usually are referred to as social impacts. Certainly, any product and material has direct impacts on different aspects of social life (e.g. working environment, wages, quality of life, consumption patterns). However, materials are also part (and often the core) of social regimes aimed at turning uncontrolled and partially unknown dangers into at least partially managed and measurable risks. Dangers can be of physical nature (e.g. energy shortage, illness, water shortage, etc.) as well as of social nature (social conflicts, poverty, threatens to personal rights, etc.). As any regimes, materials and products in turn inevitably generate new dangers requiring further regimes to be managed. Viewing materials as part of this dynamics turning around the triadic relation between dangers, social regimes and risks could be helpful for going beyond the social life cycle assessment. In the final part of the paper, the issue of the co-evolution between science and society (and therefore between materials and human agency) will be deepened and some considerations will be made on what is at stake with a more aware understanding of the intertwined interactions between materials and social relations. In the last years a growing attention has been paid \u2013 also by European institutions \u2013 to the social dimension of materials and technologies. Yet with the 6th and 7th European Framework Research Programme and, with more emphasis, with the coming programme Horizon 2020, European institutions have developed policies that are more and more focused on the tight interaction between research and those society sectors (private sector, civil society, professional network, Local Authorities, etc.) that are more involved in innovation processes. The objective of \u2009these \u2009policies \u2009is \u2009to \u2009make \u2009Member \u2009States\u2009 more competitive and able to valorize scientific and technological research, both at the economic and social levels. For a long time there has been a widespread impression that an effective control is lacking on the effects of newtechnologies and materials over, for example, climate, environment, health and also \u2013 especially, after the exponential diffusion of the Internet \u2013 on the relations between individuals and on the governance of collective life. This impression contributed to strengthen the belief that technology is something that is exogenous to social life and that is able to affect \u2013 more or less strongly \u2013 the normal course of the events. We cannot avoid to notice, however, that this idea of \u201cexogeneity\u201d of technology tends, paradoxically, to reinforce in a moment in which, as never before, the presence of science and technology in society is strong and pervasive to the extent that some technologies \u2013 in sectors such as health, transport or information \u2013 have become an essential part of the framework in which modern life develops. As we will see below, materials are an integral part of this dynamics since they are both technological products (and particularly, those with more social pervasiveness) and the basis of further technologies. How indissoluble is this relation between materials and technology clearly emerges, for example, with the development of research sectors such as nanotechnology in which materials tend to incorporate the technologies with which they are produced. It is from the big difficulties emerging from the interaction between the technological (/materials) and the social dimensions that this reflection moves. In Sections 1\u20134 we critically analyze the way in which social sciences and, particularly, sociology have interpreted, so far, the relations between science, technology and materials, on the one hand, and society on the other hand. This analysis makes it possible to demonstrate the centrality of this relation for contemporary society and its development. In Sections 5\u20137 we focus the attention on new scenarios that have been emerging in the last years and that are characterized by a growing importance of the overlapping between artificial and natural dimensions and by the advent of what can be defined as a post-natural World. In this context, we propose some thoughts concerning a view of innovation able to account for this complex situation and the possibility to anticipate the changes produced by the interaction of technology and society.

THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA THE IMPACT OF THE FREQUENCY OF TECHNOLOGY USE ON CLIENT ENGAGEMENT BEHAVIORS EXHIBITED BY CHILD WELFARE WORKERS Committee Chair: Richard Lyle, Ph.D. Dissertation dated January 2013 This study examines the relationship between the frequency of technology use and the tendency of child welfare workers to exhibit engagement behaviors with their clients. This study was based on the premise that increased technology use is negatively associated with the quality of direct human interactions. The design of this study is descriptive and quantitative in nature. To identify and describe the potential relationships between demographic, technology use, and engagement variables, numerical data were collected through an anonymous 46-item survey. A multiple regression analysis approach was used to analyze the data gathered in this study. The researcher found that the frequency of technology use has no significant relationship with how participants perceive themselves as engaging their clients. An unexpected finding yielded by this study is that the child welfare workers under study utilize technology so frequently that it becomes apparent they have little time left to have direct client contact and consequently limited opportunities to engage clients. Taken together, these findings suggest that while technology use has no significant relationship with workers' tendency to exhibit engagement behaviors during client interactions, it may be negatively associated with the frequency of opportunities workers have to exhibit those behaviors.

These policies posit the countryside as a world of `less,' compared to urban areas, and they are framed in terms of what people who are at the margins of China's modernization (migrant workers, rural residents, older people, and farmers) need in order to improve their lives, how ICT can benefit them, and how they can access more and better information despite their low educational and income levels. In contrast to this widespread view of marginalized users as passive recipients of technologies that will help them improve their material conditions, this dissertation looks at the diffusion and appropriation of ICT such as mobile phones and computers among rural residents and migrant workers in their own terms: not as foils for elite views of why they would/should go online, but rather as people who discover the opportunities offered by the Internet that are of interest to them, and try to use these opportunities as best as they can. By following the paths through which ICT travel in urban and rural China and the social relations that are maintained, renewed, and reinvented along the way, I argue that people at the margins have to `invent' themselves as users, and find a connection between themselves and ICT. Migrant workers play a key role in bringing ICT to the countryside, where family networks, shop keepers, and community life foster the circulation of information about ICT and their use. With the help of these intermediaries, even people who are typically dismissed by urban elites as non-users because of their age or educational level, and who live far away from the resource-rich areas where such devices are common, can still be connected to them through their personal ties as well as through appropriate and mediated use of new ICT. As a counter-narrative to the prevailing discourse on ICT and rural users, this dissertation argues that the combination of new technologies and personal networks are a powerful but often overlooked vector along which some aspects of urban growth are shared with the countryside, and that ICT have so far helped to strengthen the familial and personal networks commonly present in rural villages and often lamented as being broken by the dual forces of migration and urbanization.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 207, "citationCount": 16, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1686374", "name": "Elisa Oreglia"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "ce792f0e3ef67896905da4a2b56dd82bba9349d2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1796072229"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce792f0e3ef67896905da4a2b56dd82bba9349d2", "title": "Civic culture and citizenship : the nature of urban governance in interwar Manchester and Chicago", "abstract": "Due to copyright restrictions all images have been removed from the electronic version of this thesis.

As in many other African countries, the growth of mobile phone usage in Burkina Faso is higher than in Western countries, reflecting the particular appreciation of these devices. This development contrasts sharply with the difficult economic situation of many of the users. This context may explain some particular patterns of usage, and is discussed against the background of the communication principles ruling in societies still adequately described as \u2018oral societies\u2019. Domestication leads to a partial usage of the devices' technical possibilities.

Discussion about them so far has concentrated on the benefits they espouse (bridge the digital divide, promote commerce,..), what technological configuration is best (e.g. WiFi, fiber, hybrids of these,..) and who should own (and perhaps build) them (e.g. private sector, public sector, or a partnership of these,...). What has been relatively absent to date is systematic analysis of the functional and performance characteristics of the infrastructure itself. Such an analysis would be invaluable in assessing the competing claims about such benefits, technologies and ownership models. This paper offers an analytic framework for assessing public internet infrastructures. Drawing initially on familiar criteria for communications infrastructures (e.g. \u2018public interest, convenience and necessity\u2019 from longstanding US public utility law, \u2018universal and affordable\u2019 from telecommunications legislation in the US, Canada, and elsewhere), it refines and expands these in light of contemporary internet initiatives.

We examine each of these infrastructural characteristics in turn, describing what is meant by the term, and how it has been used in policy development as well as the relevant scholarly literature.

Jobs being moved abroad are less the focus than work being transferred from the processes of production and distribution into the realms of consumption and everyday life. Call centers in India have attracted tremendous attention recently in the U.S. and have become an iconic site of outsourced jobs. The cultural politics animating these reactions are discussed, and comparisons are drawn between reactions to call centers and initial encounters with ATMs, in order to elaborate how we have approached outsourcing and automation as problems for labor. Both outsourcing and automation are analyzed in terms of the mobility of work, distinguishable from the mobility of labor and capital. Call center calls and ATM (automated teller machines) transactions are described as genres of outsourced work and as instances of customers working to serve themselves. Finally, self-service is conceptualized as collaborative, and some political implications of pursuing solidarity in call centers and at ATMs are noted. One upshot of this framework is that customers serving themselves emerge, alongside discounted labor and the newly unemployed, as another key group of outsourced workers who demand our ethnographic attention.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 6, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "40684347", "name": "Michael Palm"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "b21015a409cef4422fc5c587e7c3631cf9343708", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1502313529", "DOI": "10.5860/choice.45-0065"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b21015a409cef4422fc5c587e7c3631cf9343708", "title": "Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture", "abstract": "This work provides an analysis of the ways that new media are experienced and studied as the subjects of history, using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks. In \"Always Already New\", Lisa Gitelman explores the newness of new media while she asks what it means to do media history. Using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks, Gitelman challenges readers to think about the ways that media work as the simultaneous subjects and instruments of historical inquiry. Presenting original case studies of Edison's first phonographs and the Pentagon's first distributed digital network, the ARPANET, Gitelman points suggestively toward similarities that underlie the cultural definition of records (phonographic and not) at the end of the nineteenth century and the definition of documents (digital and not) at the end of the twentieth. As a result, \"Always Already New\" speaks to present concerns about the humanities as much as to the emergent field of new media studies. Records and documents are kernels of humanistic thought, after all, part of and party to the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret. Gitelman's argument suggests inventive contexts for \"humanities computing\" while also offering a new perspective on such traditional humanities disciplines as literary history. Making extensive use of archival sources, Gitelman describes the ways in which recorded sound and digitally networked text each emerged as local anomalies that were yet deeply embedded within the reigning logic of public life and public memory. In the end, Gitelman turns to the World Wide Web and asks how the history of the Web is already being told, how the Web might also resist history, and how using the Web might be producing the conditions of its own historicity.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 238, "citationCount": 422, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "32278898", "name": "L.

His idea that these media serve to \u00abdouble\u00bb reality is developed in an analysis of the distinctive character of public events (and of \u00abbeing-in-public\u00bb) in late modern life: \u00abPublic events now occur, simultaneously, in two different places: the place of the event itself and that in which it is watched and heard. Broadcasting mediates between these two sites\u00bb (Scannell, 1996, p. 76). In proposing a \u00abphenomenological approach\u00bb to the study of radio and television (see also Scannell, 1995), which is concerned in part with the \u00abways of being in the world\u00bb (Scannell 1996, p. 173) that have been created for viewers and listeners, he goes on to argue that, for audience members in their multiple, dispersed local settings, there are transformed \u00abpossibilities of being: of being in two places at once\u00bb (Scannell, 1996, p. 91). Of course, it is only ever possible for any individual to be in one place at a time physically, but broadcasting nevertheless permits a \u00ablive\u00bb witnessing of remote happenings that can bring these happenings experientially \u00abclose\u00bb or \u00abwithin range\u00bb, thereby removing the \u00abfarness\u00bb (Scannell, 1996, p. 167). I want to suggest in this paper that Scannell\u2019s concept of the doubling of place and his reflections on the altered \u00abpossibilities of being\u00bb for media users, while they appear in a book devoted to the study of broadcasting, might also be applied more generally in the analysis of those electronic media, such as the Internet and telephone, which share with radio and television a capacity for the virtually instantaneous transmission of information across sometimes vast spatial distances.

This paper attempts to explain their diffusion across the 48 contiguous states during the time of their initial popularization and fastest growth and examines which macrostructural attributes of states encouraged or discouraged their widespread adoption. It also examines whether these technologies stimulated or inhibited each other. The findings suggest that commercialization in urban centers spurred adoption of both the telephone and automobile. A more complex process occurred in rural America. States with many well-off, independent farmers were relatively quick adopters of both technologies. But states with many tenant farmers-primarily southern-were slow to adopt. The data also point to an important historical watershed, World War I: many of the accelerating factors before the war were less critical after the war, and, perhaps more important, the interaction between the technologies changed around the time of the war.", "venue": "American Journal of Sociology", "year": 1988, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 34, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "34525431", "name": "C.
