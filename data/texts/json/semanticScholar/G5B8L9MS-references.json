First, the probability calculus is interpreted as a semantics for truth functional logic. Absolute probabilities are treated as degrees of rational belief. Conditional probabilities are explicitly defined in terms of absolute probabilities in the familiar way. Second, the probability calculus is extended in order to provide an interpretation for counterfactual probabilities--conditional probabilities where the condition has zero probability. Third, conditional propositions are introduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the conditional probability of the consequent on the antecedent. An axiom system for this conditional connective is recovered from the probabilistic definition. Finally, the primary semantics for this axiom system, presented elsewhere, is related to the probabilistic interpretation.", "venue": "Philosophy of Science", "year": 1970, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount": 282, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2358665", "name": "Robert Stalnaker"}]}}, {"contexts": ["Against our intuitions, David Lewis (1976; 1986) showed that this is not possible: there is no proposition that can fulfil this requirement.", "David Papineau, Philosophical Devices: Proofs, Probabilities, Possibilities, and Sets."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "c6b07f0a8de7a09498dcd9afce9dc70b0a7f101d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2307/2185051"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6b07f0a8de7a09498dcd9afce9dc70b0a7f101d", "title": "PROBABILITIES OF CONDITIONALS AND CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES II", "abstract": "A dams's thesis about indicative conditionals is that their assertIlability goes by the conditional subjective probability of the consequent given the antecedent, in very much the same way that assertability normally goes by the subjective probability of truth.'
