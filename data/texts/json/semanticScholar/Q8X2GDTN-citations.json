The methodology used is retrospective textual analysis based on the playing of approximately 600 rounds of Warsong Gulch for pleasure between 2008 and 2010. A rationale for this methodology is provided, and its theoretical underpinnings are specified. The difficulties inherent to the evaluation of research strategies in an inter-disciplinary field are noted. It is acknowledged that online games are populated, social spaces and argued that theories of textuality are nevertheless pertinent because of the manner in which players are available to one another during a game and because players\u2019 arguments during play indicate the presence of multiple and even conflicting interpretations. The analysis leads into a discussion about what constitutes violence in this context and the problems inherent to differentiating between competitive and collaborative play. It is argued that there is a relationship between conflicting interpretation and player-to-player pedagogy.", "venue": "CGAMES 2012", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "143709036", "name": "D.
