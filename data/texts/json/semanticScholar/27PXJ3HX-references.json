How can we know, and how important is it? In this book Richard Kraut, one of our most respected analytical philosophers, reorients these questions around the notion of what causes human beings to flourish - that is, what is good for us. Observing that we can sensibly talk about what is good for plants and animals no less than what is good for people, Kraut advocates a general principle that applies to the entire world of living things: what is good for complex organisms consists in the maturation and exercise of their natural powers. Drawing on the insights of ancient Greek philosophy, Kraut develops this thought into a good-centred moral philosophy, an \"ethics of well-being\" that requires all of our efforts to do some good. Even what is good of a kind - good poems no less than good people - must be good for someone. Pleasure plays a key role in this idea of flourishing life, but Kraut opposes the current philosophical orthodoxy of well-being, which views a person's welfare as a construct of rational desires or plans, actual or ideal. The practical upshot of Kraut's theory is that many common human pursuits - for riches, fame, domination - are in themselves worthless, while some of the familiar virtues - justice, honesty and autonomy - are good for every human being.", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 154, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48095218", "name": "R.

At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and pro ductivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.1 Writing in Technology and Culture almost two decades ago, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one version of the theme, arguing that \"from late neo lithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable.\"2 This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city, architecture, and the his tory of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other nineteenth century critics of industrial ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, \"The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state.\" Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that \"dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism.\"3 An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is by no means the exclusive property of critics of large-scale high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the \"biggest and best\" that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice. The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, the space program, and of course nuclear power itself have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces.

I conclude in this part that this understanding of rights is mistaken. In Part II, I urge that the pragmatic argument put forward by rights critics and some welfare advocates for forgoing rights-talk and rights-rhetoric also fails: there are very real costs, both in theory and in law, in deciding to forgo putting the case for the state's obligation to provide minimal material goods in terms of rights. In Part III, I briefly describe two core rights that a refashioned liberal state, understood as a vehicle for protecting not just the liberty but also the capabilities of citizens, should recognize: first, a right to be protected against private violence, and second, a right of caregivers to give care to dependents without incurring the risk of severe impoverishment or subordination \u2013 a right, to use the provocative phrase coined by the philosopher Eva Kittay, to doulia. Both rights, I think, are directly entailed by the state's obligation to provide the minimal preconditions for the development of those fundamental human capabilities that are themselves essential to a fully human life. Both rights however, could be and should be conceived in the most traditionally liberal terms. The first such right \u2013 the right to protection against private violence \u2013 although now disfavored in United States rights discourse, seems fully authorized by both the liberal tradition and the American Constitution itself. The second right for which I will argue \u2013 the right to provide care to dependents has no similar basis of support in either liberal theory or American constitutionalism. It is not incompatible with either, however, and is at least arguably required by the deepest commitments of both. The right to protection and the right to care are rights that can be framed in liberal terms, and both rights would go a long way toward securing for individual citizens the minimal preconditions of a good society.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145387089", "name": "R.

There is currently much enthusiasm about the potential of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), and the immense information resources contained on the World Wide Web, to improve the lives of those who have access to them. But at the same time, there is mounting concern over the uneven distribution of the new information wealth, both within nations and internationally. Some even fear that we may be heading for a regime of local and global \u2018information-apartheid\u2019 (Ratan 1995; Wresch 1996; Loader 1998; Schiller 1996), in which the \u2018information-haves\u2019 are segregated from the \u2018information have-nots\u2019. A host of empirical research adds force to such concerns. According to a 2005 UNCTAD study (UNCTAD 2006) the digital divide in the first years of the twenty-first century between nations is still wide. A person in a high-income country is more than twenty-two times more likely to be an Internet user than one in a low-income nation. In a high-income country, Internet affordability relative to income is more than150 times better than in a low-income nation.

Should agency be assigned to them in accounts of social change? Or are human beings and social structures like groups and organisations the only social agents? This is a pivotal question for technology studies, but one that has not received an unequivocal answer so far. On the one hand, the literature in technology studies is filled with examples and cases that suggest that technological artifacts and systems do act: they have been claimed to prescribe behaviours, constrain political arrangements, induce cultural beliefs and practices, and shape aspects of their social context. On the other hand, the social constructivist orientation of a large part of technology studies seems to be incompatible with an attribution of agency to artifacts, because it maintains that alleged properties of artifacts can be reduced to the actions and interpretations of social groups. There is general agreement in technology studies that the introduction and use of a new technology is often accompanied by significant changes in its social context. Such changes may include changes in individual and collective behaviours, attitudes and beliefs, in social statuses and roles, and in social structures and institutions. This generally accepted idea goes against the notion that technologies are neutral, in the sense that they are mere means-toends that function to perform certain tasks more quickly, efficiently or powerfully, and that a proper analysis of them focusses on their function as a means to chosen ends. It is a core belief of technology studies that technologies must also be understood, and perhaps centrally, as building blocks of society and as instigators of social change, in ways that are often unrelated to their intended functions. But here the agreement stops.One may agree that the widespread use of the birth-control pill has been accompanied by, and can be correlated with, sexual liberation and greater freedom for women, and that without the pill these", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 32, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39979166", "name": "P.
