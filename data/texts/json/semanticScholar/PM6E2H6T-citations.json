An analysis of the examination results revealed that this approach helped the students to learn the concepts better and score 1% more marks. Moreover, a strong correlation between the marks obtained by the students for questions related to designing of automata and their total score was identified. In a survey conducted at the end of the semester, the students said that it was difficult to use two tools for learning the same concepts.

Exploring one author\u2019s corpus of texts in order to discover the various properties of a concept is a classic example of CA. Recently, a corpus-based computational framework for CA has been emerging in response to the methodological challenges brought about by the massive digitization of texts. In this framework, CA is approached by implementing a computer-assisted text analysis method, within which algorithms are used to support the various cognitive operations involved in CA. In this article, we focus on the retrieval of relevant text segments for analysis. However, this is a complex issue within a computational framework, since the relation between concept and natural language depends on several semantic phenomena, including synonymy , polysemy, and contextual modulation . The main contribution of this article is methodological because it explores the computational approach to CA. We present three algorithmic methods, which identify relevant text segments while taking into account various semantic phenomena. The results show the potential of computer-assisted CA, thereby highlighting the need to overcome the limitations of these first experiments.

Models and simulations each have unique affordances and limitations, and it is useful to leverage their affordances to mitigate their respective limitations. One way to do this is by generating the simulations based on the conceptual models, preserving the capacity for rapid revision and knowledge sharing allowed by the conceptual models while extending them to provide the repeated testing and feedback of the simulations. In this paper, we present an interactive system called MILAfiS for generating agent-based simulations from conceptual models of ecological systems. Designed with STEM education in mind, this user-centered interface design allows the user to construct a Component-Mechanism-Phenomenon conceptual model of a complex system, and then compile the conceptual model into an executable NetLogo simulation.

Purpose: This paper aims to show how the info-computational approach (IC) can reinforce constructivist ideas about the nature of cognition and knowledge and, conversely, how constructivist insights (such as that the process of cognition is the process of life) can inspire new models of computing. Method: The info-computational constructive framework is presented for the modeling of cognitive processes in cognizing agents. Parallels are drawn with other constructivist approaches to cognition and knowledge generation. We describe how cognition as a process of life itself functions based on info-computation and how the process of knowledge generation proceeds through interactions with the environment and among agents. Results: Cognition and knowledge generation in a cognizing agent is understood as interaction with the world (potential information), which by processes of natural computation becomes actual information. That actual information after integration becomes knowledge for the agent. Heinz von Foerster is identified as a precursor of natural computing, in particular bio computing. Implications: IC provides a framework for unified study of cognition in living organisms (from the simplest ones, such as bacteria, to the most complex ones) as well as in artifactual cognitive systems. Constructivist content: It supports the constructivist view that knowledge is actively constructed by cognizing agents and shared in a process of social cognition. IC argues that this process can be modeled as info-computation.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 298, "citationCount": 21, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1403731773", "name": "G.

The established process model represents the KD process in a linear and technology-centered manner, as a sequence of transformations that refine raw data into more and more abstract and distilled representations. Any actual KD process, however, has aspects that are not adequately covered by this model. In particular, some of the most important actors in the process are not technological but human, and the operations associated with these actors are interactive rather than sequential in nature. This thesis proposes an augmentation of the established model that addresses this neglected dimension of the KD process. The proposed process model is composed of three sub-models: a data model, a workflow model, and an architectural model. Each sub-model views the KD process from a different angle: the data model examines the process from the perspective of different states of data and transformations that convert data from one state to another, the workflow model describes the actors of the process and the interactions between them, and the architectural model guides the design of software for the execution of the process. For each of the sub-models, the thesis first defines a set of requirements, then presents the solution designed to satisfy the requirements, and finally, re-examines the requirements to show how they are accounted for by the solution. The principal contribution of the thesis is a broader perspective on the KD process than what is currently the mainstream view. The augmented KD process model proposed by the thesis makes use of the established model, but expands it by gathering data management and knowledge representation, KD workflow and software architecture under a single unified model. Furthermore, the proposed model considers issues that are usually either overlooked or treated as separate from the KD process, such as the philosophical aspect of KD. The thesis also discusses a number of technical solutions to individual sub-problems of the KD process, including two software frameworks and four case-study applications that serve as concrete implementations and illustrations of several key features of the proposed process model.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 192, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1935063", "name": "L.

However, there are different types of feedback, and not all feedback is effective. Here we introduce recursive feedback (RF), which occurs when tutors observe their pupils use what they have been taught. Two experiments examined the value of RF during learning by teaching. In the first study adults taught another adult face to face about human biology. Those participants who observed their pupil interact with an examiner exhibited superior learning relative to individuals in several control conditions that included elements of learning by teaching but not RF. The second study examined whether RF benefits extend to teaching computerized teachable agents in regular classrooms. High school students played games in which they induced logical rules.

Here we use a case-study from studies of language evolution, and ideas from philosophy of science, to illustrate a robustness approach to learning from models. Robust properties are those that arise across a range of models, simulations and experiments, and can be used to identify key causal structures in the models, and the phenomenon, under investigation. For example, in studies of language evolution, the emergence of compositional structure is a robust property across models, simulations and experiments of cultural transmission, but only under pressures for learnability and expressivity. This arguably illustrates the principles underlying real cases of language evolution. We provide an outline of the robustness approach, including its limitations, and suggest that this methodology can be productively used throughout cognitive science.

It puts the emphasis not on languages nor on models, but more precisely on symbols, on their extensions, and on their various ways of referring. It shows that chains of reference of symbols in CSs are multiple and of different kinds. As they are distinct and diverse, these chains enable different kinds of remoteness of reference and different kinds of validation for CSs. Although some methodological papers have already but implicitly taken into account the heterogeneity and variety of the relationships of reference in CSs, hence of cross-validations, this diversity is still overlooked in the epistemological literature on CSs. As a consequence, a particular outcome of this analytical and explicitly extensional view is an ability to classify existing epistemological theses on the epistemic status of CSs according to what their authors choose to select and put at the forefront: either the extensions of symbols, or the symbol-types, or the symbol-tokens, or the internal denotational hierarchies of the CS seen as a whole or the references of these hierarchies to external denotational hierarchies seen as wholes. Through the adoption of this extensionalist view together with its precise conceptual differentiations, it also becomes possible to explain more precisely the reasons why some complete reduction of the epistemic role of CSs to classical epistemic paradigms such as \"experience\", \"experiment\", or \"theoretical argument\" remains doubtful. On this last point, in particular, this paper is in agreement with what many epistemologists already have acknowledged.

The thesis uses existing research on activities and interactions in business relationships in order to identify social mechanisms that constitute a causal explanation of the self-organisation of an interdependent production system. These mechanisms are implemented in a computer model of autonomous agents, and the implementation is validated through the reproduction of stylised facts from prior laboratory experiments.

Between 1997 and now, developments in Information Technologies (ITs) like the Internet have accelerated and further transformed information exchanges (See Guri-Rosenblit, 2005), and by 2007, Fuchs (2007) could legitimately begin his Internet and Society: Social Theory in the Information Age with the observation that the \"Internet is ubiquitous in everyday life.\" Since information exchange and analysis are key aspects of the learning experience, it is not surprising that these developments have had, and will continue to have a significant impact on education. For example, according to an October 2003 supplement to the Current Population Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, among U.S. children 3 to 17 years of age, 83.4% of children enrolled in school in 2003 used a computer at school, and 43.1% used the internet at school. (Day, Janus, and Davis, 2005; Also, see Rovai and Wighting, 2005) An even more recent survey by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, reporting 2009 statistics and information about online education in the United States, notes that for the past six years, 2003-2009, \"online enrollments have been growing substantially faster than overall higher education enrollments.\" (Allen and Seaman, 2010) This continues the earlier trend from 2004 when the same authors reported that 65% \"of schools offering graduate face-to-face courses also offer graduate courses online\", while 63% of schools \"offering undergraduate face-to-face courses also offer undergraduate courses online.\" (Allen and Seaman, 2005) Within this context, the important question concerns the sort of educational relationships that exist (or fail to exist) when information exchanges and analyses are structured by the use of ITs such as the Internet. If one carefully examines educational relationships, there is ample reason to believe that there is more to education than simple information exchange. (See Guri-Rosenblit, 2005) For example, while \"multiple measures of learning success exist\" (Song et al., 2007), in the United States it is common for universities and colleges to poll students on how \"successful\" the instructor has been in his or her teaching. (See Spencer and Schmelkin, 2002) Among the questions in such polls are those asking the students' opinions whether the instructor was \"enthusiastic about teaching the class\", whether the instructor \"showed concern for students\", whether the instructor \"had a genuine interest in students\", and whether the \"instructor's style of presentation held your interest during class.\" At the very least, this suggests that successful educational relationships include much more than just the exchange of information; the manner/mode and context of information exchange also is important when it comes to assessing teaching. (See King, 2002) Thus, in what follows we will use ideas from writers not normally linked to discussions about IT use in education, Levinas and Aristotle, to argue that there are important kinds of relationships that, ideally, emerge within face-to-face education settings but not, typically, within education entirely mediated by the use of ITs. Further, we will argue that the importance of the relationships that emerge within face-to-face educational settings suggest that, short of the appropriate adoption and use of enhancements potentially offered by increased bandwidth such as three-dimensional learning environments (See Dalgarno and Lee, 2010) or broadband videoconferencing (Smyth, 2005), Internet-based education should supplement, but not supplant face-to-face education. Levinas On the assumption that the manner/mode and context of information exchange is an important component of successful teaching, the question is how face-to-face educational relationships differ from those mediated by ITs such as the Internet. \u2026", "venue": "J.

It tends to prompt original ideas, to shape new concepts, and to cause unprecedented problems. It usually embeds but also challenges ethical values and perspectives. In short, technology can be a very powerful force for intellectual innovation, exercising a profound influence on how we conceptualize, interpret, and transform the world. Add to that the fact that the more ontologically powerful and pervasive a technology is, the more profound and lasting its intellectual influence is going to be. Recall that technology has had an escalating importance in human affairs at least since the invention of printing and the scientific revolution.

It is not only that we are vitally dependent on computers in our work and surrounded by ubiquitous computing in our daily lives. Even the Cosmos nowadays is envisaged as a network of computational processes, the stance known as pancomputationalism or naturalist computationalism. In the complementary outlook, the universe, on its most fundamental physical level, is seen as consisting of information which is a view of paninformationalism or informational structural realism. This book goes a step further and develops a synthetic framework by integrating pancomputationalism and paninformationalism. The universe is perceived as being engaged in the computing of its own future states through physical processes of dynamical changes in the informational structure. Computation is thus in the most general form understood as information processing which can be seen at different levels of informational organization.

These are complementary fields of research in adaptive and cognitive systems, as building such systems generally relies and starts with theoretical foundations and theoretical considerations are always raised when synthesizing such systems. Indeed, computer simulation, on one hand, is heavily influenced by both formal theoretical constraints and empirical constraints in the design of the environment, the morphological definitions of sensors and effectors, and the implementation of cognitive architecture and processes of the conceived artificial systems. On the other hand, simulations offer the opportunity to quantify and formalize ideas, concepts and propositions that constitute a theory in terms of programming (Parisi 2001).

As such, computer technology is arguably the technology that has had the most profound impact on philosophy. Philosophers have studied computer technology and its philosophical implications extensively, and this chapter gives an overview of the field. We start with definitions and historical overviews of the field and its various subfields. We then consider studies of the fundamental nature and basic principles of computing and computational systems, before moving on to philosophy of computer science, which investigates the nature, scope and methods of computer science. Under this heading, we will also address such topics as data modeling, ontology in computer science, programming languages, software engineering as an engineering discipline, management of information systems, the use of computers for simulation, and human-computer interaction. Subsequently, we will address the issue in computing that has received the most attention from philosophers, artificial intelligence (AI). The purpose of this section is to give an overview of the philosophical issues raised by the notion of creating intelligent machines. We consider philosophical critiques of different approaches within AI and pay special attention to philosophical studies of applications of AI. We then turn to a section on philosophical issues pertaining to new media and the Internet, including the convergence between media and digital computers. The theoretical and ethical issues raised by this relatively recent phenomenon are diverse.

This diversity of model type and model use is a good thing for science. Indeed, it is crucial especially for the biological and cognitive sciences, which have to solve many different problems at many different scales, ranging from the most concrete of the structural details of a DNA molecule to the most abstract and generic principles of self-organization in networks. Getting a grip (or more likely many separate grips) on this range of topics calls for a teeming forest of techniques, including many different modeling techniques. Barbara Webb\u2019s target article strikes us as a proposal for clear-cutting the forest. We think clear-cutting here would be as good for science as it is for non-metaphorical forests. Our argument for this is primarily a recitation of a few of the ways that diversity has been useful. Recently, looking at the actual practice of artificial life modelers, one of us distinguished four uses of simulation models classified in terms of the position the models take up between theory and data (see Figure 1). The classification is not exhaustive, and the barriers between kinds are not absolute. Rather, the purpose of the taxonomy is to open up the view for an epistemic ecology of modeling practices. First, and closest to the empirical domain, there are mechanistic models, in which there is an almost one-to-one correspondence between variables in the model and observables in the target system and its environment. Webb\u2019s cricket robot is a paradigmatic example of this type. Second, there are functional models, which aim for a behavioral or functional rather than a variable-to-variable correspondence between the model system and its target. Many models in cognitive psychology are of this type, as are many in biology when the underlying mechanisms are not accessible to modeling correspondence (see Vickerstaff & Di Paolo, 2005, for a good example of this). Third, there are generic models, which cover a wide spectrum of phenomena in search for generic principles of complex systems. Cellular automata, random Boolean networks, and the like belong to this class. Finally, there are conceptual models, which do not target any particular natural system nor a wide spectrum of them. Instead conceptual models are built from theories, for which they embody assumptions, illustrate concepts, simulate theoretical principles, and so forth. Beer\u2019s model and many other animats are of this type (for more details see Barandiaran, 2008, chap. 2; Barandiaran & Moreno, 2006). Modeling is a relational activity, it involves the template or construct (usually referred as the model) and also an interpretative framework (made of assumptions, generalizations, definitions, etc.) that puts the model in connection with other models, theories or objects. It is this interpretative framework and the modelers\u2019 intentions that situate a given model into one of the categories of models. But only mechanistic models are used as Webb suggests all models should be: \u201cthe cricket robot is a mixed physical and computational implementation of a particular hypothesis about an observed phenomenon of sensorimotor behavior in", "venue": "Adapt.

Add to that the fact that the more ontologically powerful and pervasive a technology is, the more profound and lasting its intellectual influence is going to be.

It is not only that we are vitally dependent on computers in our work and surrounded by ubiquitous computing in our daily lives. Even the Cosmos nowadays is envisaged as a network of computational processes, the stance known as pancomputationalism or naturalist computationalism. In the complementary outlook, the universe, on its most fundamental physical level, is seen as consisting of information which is a view of paninformationalism or informational structural realism. This book goes a step further and develops a synthetic framework by integrating pancomputationalism and paninformationalism. The universe is perceived as being engaged in the computing of its own future states through physical processes of dynamical changes in the informational structure. Computation is thus in the most general form understood as information processing which can be seen at different levels of informational organization.

But little attention has been paid to the possibility of conceiving (and modelling) behaviour in terms of a self-maintaining organized unity in analogy with minimal forms of proto-cellular (or autopoietic) life. We propose that the behavioural counterpart of a network of self-sustaining chemical reactions should be a network of interactively maintained sensorimotor dissipative structures (habits) that emerge from the continuous reciprocal interaction between brain, body and world (and not, as in previous attempts, between molecular processes and neural processes, conceiving the nervous system as operationally closedVarela, 1979, Principles of Biological Autonomy, Elsevier). Despite its popularity among pre-Darwinian biologists (such as Aristotle, Lamarck or Bichat), pragmatists and phenomenologists alike (Dewey, Merleau-Ponty) and among pre-computationalist psychologists (like James, Goldstein, Ivo Kohler or Piaget) the notion of habit has received little attention within Artificial Life. Habits posses key properties that make them extremely attractive for modelling the organization of behaviour: a) the structure of habits can be traced back to a fully operational-dynamicist framework, b) they do not presuppose a distinction or a causal priority between perception and action, c) habits are inherently situated or enactive structures cutting across brain, body and environment, d) habits are plastic and malleable, e) habits provide a concrete sense of self-maintenance (they are both cause and effect of their occurrence) potentially implying an intrinsic and a interactive teleology and f) habits can be nested or composed at different scales. This opens up the possibility for an operational notion of what might be called Mental Life (Barandiaran, 2007, The World, the Mind and the Body, p. 49, Imprint Academic) as the continued formation of a web of habits through sensorimotor interactions whose cohesive self-maintenance constitutes the identity of a cognitive (as opposed to barely biological) agent and the world it thereby co-defines. We use some recent evolutionary robotic models on preference and habit formation (Di Paolo & Iizuka, 2008, Biosystems, 91, p. 409) to illustrate and explore the theoretical and philosophical implications of taking sensorimotor habits as the building blocks of behavioural organization. This organization takes the form of an attractor landscape whose stability is homeodynamically maintained through sensorimotor coupling. Mental Life opens up a new object of modelling in its own right, closer to the Aristotelian notion of psyche (or even the Heideggerian notion of Dasein) than to the notion of information processing, adaptive problem solving or weak conceptions of autonomy in robotics. Artificial Mental Life involves a shift from building artificial systems that satisfy externally imposed norms (engineering or evolutionary) to systems capable of generating their own norms: those required to sustain their own behavioural organization. In turn, it can become a source of new research questions to investigate the dynamics of assimilation and accommodation into an existing organization, its shaping by social interactions and institutions, or mental disorders dealing with stability, stress, identity, etc.", "venue": "ALIFE", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1734288", "name": "Xabier E.

It starts by presenting arguments for analytical social research, touching on epistemological, theoretical and methodological issues. After having introduced and debated the analytical approach to social theory, it describes a kind of bounded rationality that seems to be consistent with both the methodological individualism implied by the approach and the need for final explanations of social phenomena. The focus then passes onto the choice of an appropriate tool for the analysis of social systems: Agent Based Simulations. In the second half of the work this framework is applied to a social dilemma, voluntary public good provision. The critical point about the provision of public good is connected to the general social dilemma of cooperation: individuals would improve their wealth by making a full contribution to the public good in the case of cooperation with others, but free riding can be widespread and have a strong impact on the system dynamics. Thus the work, having introduced some not very common tools, concentrates on attempts to analyse and simulate the behaviour of subjects in economic experiments about the voluntary provision of public goods, pointing out that the mechanism in such dilemma is mainly the result of conditional cooperation. A case study of a rural community in Italy helps to validate the results and to direct attention to some other key issues, such as the structure of the interactions between the community members.

Ten years later, this new special issue charts some of the progress made in our understanding of visual argument, presents state-of-the-art papers exploring visual argument, and points the way to new issues and topics that need to be explored. In our previous introduction, we argued that it was time to reject assumptions that excluded the visual from the various strands of argumentation theory (Birdsell and Groarke). We emphasized three prerequisites for a theory of visual argument: an acceptance of visual meaning, a broader recognition of the argumentative aspects of representation and resemblance, and a better account of the relationship between images and the contexts in which they occur. Today, we think it is possible to elaborate on these prerequisites. In doing so, we provide the outlines of a theory of visual argument. In the future, we hope that these outlines will be expanded and elaborated in a way that can account for the great variety of images that inform the world of visual argument. VISUAL ARGUMENTS We understand visual arguments to be arguments (in the traditional premise and conclusion sense) which are conveyed in images. Like verbal arguments, they can be understood and analyzed through the standard components of arguments. For example, we can understand and assess such arguments by applying Aristotle's rhetorical framework: by asking how individual visual arguments should be understood and assessed from the point of view of logos, pathos, and ethos. Images play a key role in many kinds of argument, for a variety of reasons. In some cases, they more accurately and concisely present information and evidence that is relevant to an argument. In other cases, they have rhetorical advantages and are more forceful and persuasive than words. A description of a horrible crime is unlikely to be as powerful as a video, even if the action in the video is a re-enactment. Some visual arguments are made up entirely of visual elements, but many incorporate verbal components. Authors attempting to construct convincing arguments in real life use whatever means are at their disposal. They tend to see the verbal and the visual as complementary modes of communication, combining them in ways that build on their respective strengths. THE PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION Traditional accounts of the meaning of images have been major obstacles to recognition of the significance of images in argument. Among other things, such accounts maintain that images cannot assert; that they are too vague and ambiguous to function as propositions; that they are emotional and never cognitive; that they cannot express negations; and that words have ultimate authority in the realm of argument (see, e.g., Fleming; Johnson). Here, we outline an emerging view of images and their meaning which is more conducive to their role in visual argument. It is consistent with the view of communicative speech acts that informs the pragma-dialectical view of argument. Pragma-dialectics maintains that we should interpret speech acts in a way that renders them comprehensible, sincere, relevant, consistent, and appropriate in the context of the other speech acts that surround them (Eemeren and Grootendorst 49-55). The principles of communication play an important role in the interpretation of speech acts that are figurative, implicit, or metaphorical, or in some other way demand something more than a literal interpretation. Eemeren and Grootendorst's principles of communication, for example, enable us to interpret the remark that \"Julie is a block of ice\" not literally (a claim that would be incomprehensible) but as a metaphorical way to claim that Julie is cold and unfriendly. Groarke has shown how the pragma-dialectical principles of communication can be applied to our interpretation of images in argument. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount": 93, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "113586423", "name": "David S.

This article is a recast of the problem in the context of data mining. We formulate the problem precisely in the rough set-based decision logic and discuss its implications for the research of data mining. 1 The Circular Justi\u00a3cation of Induction Induction is widely accepted as a cornerstone of the modern scienti\u00a3c methodology. It regards the systematic use of past experiences in the prediction of the future. According to Hume\u2019s epistemology, our beliefs are established on the basis of observation and can be divided into two cases: 1. Observed matters of fact. 2. Unobserved matters of fact. While the beliefs of observed matters of fact are based directly on observation, unobserved matters of fact can only be known indirectly on the basis of observation by means of inductive argument. An argument is called inductive if it passes from singular statements regarding the results of observations to universal statements, such as hypotheses or theories. The inductive argument can be formulated deductively as follows: Let \u03c6(x) denote a hypothesis regarding the individuals x we are interested in. In general, \u03c6(x) is in the form of a universal conditional sentence \u201cP (x) \u2283 Q(x)\u201d, however it is not necessarily so.

Its birth can be traced to the 1940s, when wider academic interest in automatic computing was triggered by the construction of the first fully electronic, digital, Turing-complete computer, ENIAC, in 1945 and the concomitant birth of the stored-program paradigm (see, e.g., Aspray, 2000). It still took some 20 years for computer science to achieve a disciplinary identity distinct from fields such as mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and logic (cf. Atchison et al., 1968; Rice & Rosen, 2004). Throughout the short history of electronic digital computing, there has been a great variety of approaches, definitions, and outlooks on computing as a discipline. Arguments about the content of the field, its methods, and its aims have sometimes been fierce, and the rapid pace of extension of the field has made it even harder to define computer science (see Tedre, 2006, pp. 255-351). Over the last 60 years, researchers in the fields of computing have brought together a variety of scientific disciplines and research methodologies. The resulting science--computer science--offers a variety of ways for explaining phenomena; most notably it offers computational models and algorithms. The increased investments in research efforts in computer science have been paralleled by the growth of the number of computing-centered fields, such as computer engineering, scientific computation, electrical engineering, decision support systems, architectural design, and software engineering. Although interdisciplinarity has made the development of computer science possible in the first place (cf. Bowles, 1996; Puchta, 1996; Williams, 1985, p. 209), it also poses a very real challenge to computer scientists. Firstly, it is not certain what kinds of topics should be considered to be computer science proper. The attempts to describe computer science are invariably either very narrow and applicable to only some subfields of computer science (e.g., Dijkstra, 1974), or so broad that they do not exclude much (e.g., Newell, Perlis, & Simon, 1967). Secondly, it is very difficult to come up with an overarching set of rules of how computer science research should ideally be done. The subjects that computer scientists study include, for instance, programs, logic, formulae, people, complexity, machines, usability, and systems. An overarching set of rules for computer science research should cover research in fields such as software engineering, complexity theory, usability, the psychology of programming, management information systems, virtual reality, and architectural design. It is uncertain if an overarching, all-inclusive definition of computer science is possible, and if such definition is even necessary. It is important for computer scientists to understand the challenges (and possibilities) that the vast diversity of computer science research can cause. Many disputes about how computer scientists should work have their roots in different conceptions about what computer science actually is (cf. Denning et al., 1989). Many misunderstandings and controversies between scientists from different branches of computer science might be avoided by their understanding the research traditions within which people in those branches work. Even more importantly, computer scientists must know that the same approaches cannot be used with the whole variety of subjects that computer scientists study. Mathematical and computational models are precise and unambiguous, yet they are confined to the abstract world of mathematics and they fail to capture the richness of physical and social reality. Narratives and ethnographies are rich in dimension and sensitive to detail, yet equivocal and context-dependent. Narratives have little use in deriving formulae, and formal proofs have little explanatory power regarding usability. It has been argued that there are three particularly lucid traditions in computer science: the theoretical tradition, the empirical tradition, and the engineering tradition (cf. \u2026", "venue": "J.

Specifically, our thesis is that the systems developer and software consumer (user or customer) join forces \u2013 not as Popperian falsifiers, who make a decision rule to reject the prototype on account of any divergence, major or minor, from the software consumer\u2019s mental model, but \u2013 as Quinean revisers, with the objective of fine\u2010tuning the prototype (or the software consumer\u2019s mental model) so that the prototype and the software consumer\u2019s mental model are congruent with each other. This paper suggests that prototype revisions are belief revisions, and, as such, should be guided \u2013 and are guided \u2013 by pragmatic norms, such as conservatism, simplicity and generality, and are influenced by social, or sociological, factors as well.

On the other hand, computer systems have intentionality, and because of this, they should not be dismissed from the realm of morality in the same way that natural objects are dismissed. Natural objects behave from necessity; computer systems and other artifacts behave from necessity after they are created and deployed, but, unlike natural objects, they are intentionally created and deployed. Failure to recognize the intentionality of computer systems and their connection to human intentionality and action hides the moral character of computer systems. Computer systems are components in human moral action. When humans act with artifacts, their actions are constituted by the intentionality and efficacy of the artifact which, in turn, has been constituted by the intentionality and efficacy of the artifact designer.

The construction of informational ontologies is an example of it.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "67260838", "name": "Ania Hern\u00e1ndez Quintana"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "b7e48fa58e370b45576d22074a90d6e8b7dfd447", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/mima/Dorbolo06a", "DOI": "10.1007/s11023-006-9011-9"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7e48fa58e370b45576d22074a90d6e8b7dfd447", "title": "Introduction", "abstract": "The American Philosophical Association awarded the 2003 Barwise Prize to Daniel Dennett, given in recognition of \u2018\u2018significant and sustained contributions to areas relevant to philosophy and computing\u2019\u2019 in order to \u2018\u2018acknowledge and to encourage work in all areas relevant to the \u2018\u2018computational turn\u2019\u2019 that is occurring in our profession\u2019\u2019 (APA, 2000). In order understand the value of Dennett\u2019s unique contributions with respect to this award, it is necessary to get clear on what the \u2018\u2018philosophical turn\u2019\u2019 is. The phrase \u2018\u2018computational turn\u2019\u2019 is attributed to Leslie Burkholder (University of British Columbia), (Cavalier, 2000). Terrell Bynum (Southern Connecticut State University) and James Moor (Dartmouth) are frequent exponents of the idea that philosophy is undergoing a computational turn (Bynum and Moor, 1998). Burkholder, Cavalier, Bynum, and Moor intend to make an analogy to the linguistic turn which dominated Anglo/ American philosophy for much of the 20th century. Just as the issues and methods of 20th century analytic philosophy (and other fields) increasingly clustered around structure, meaning, and use in language, so too will the issues and methods of 21st century philosophy become increasingly clustered around factors arising from computing and information. Information technology is fundamentally changing the means by which philosophy will be conducted in the future. The computation turn in philosophy is examined at Computing and Philosophy conferences (CAP) several times each year around the world (IACAP, 2005). Attendees at these conferences address issues such as artificial intelligence, artificial life, information ethics, machine learning, machine consciousness, robotics, and information technology in education. Throughout his prolific span of writing, Dennett has taken on all of these issues with his unique style. The contributors to this issue of Minds and Machines give testimony to Dennett\u2019s significance in this regard by examining aspects of Dennett\u2019s computingrelated philosophy.", "venue": "Minds and Machines", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 1, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2122850", "name": "Jon Dorbolo"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "c68acb1f3529bcc3ccc38c358feb60682c24a075", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2078469602", "DOI": "10.1162/BIOT.2006.1.3.280"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c68acb1f3529bcc3ccc38c358feb60682c24a075", "title": "Flow of Information in Molecular Biological Mechanisms", "abstract": "In 1958, Francis Crick distinguished the flow of information from the flow of matter and the flow of energy in the mechanism of protein synthesis.

Flow of matter from beginning to end does not occur in the protein synthesis mechanism; flow of information (from Crick\u2019s perspective) does.

VMRs (e.g., geometric structures, graphs, and diagrams) refer to graphical representations that visually encode properties and relationships of mathematical structures and concepts. Currently, most mathematical tools provide methods by which a learner can interact with these representations. Interaction, in such cases, mediates between the VMR and the thinking, reasoning, and intentions of the learner, and is often intended to support the cognitive tasks that the learner may want to perform on or with the representation. This paper brings together a diverse set of interaction techniques and categorizes and describes them according to their common characteristics, goals, intended benefits, and features. In this way, this paper aims to provide a preliminary framework to help designers of mathematical cognitive tools in their selection and analysis of different interaction techniques as well as to foster the design of more innovative interactive mathematical tools. An effort is made to demonstrate how the different interaction techniques developed in the context of other disciplines (e.g., information visualization) can support a diverse set of mathematical tasks and activities involving VMRs.", "venue": "Int.
