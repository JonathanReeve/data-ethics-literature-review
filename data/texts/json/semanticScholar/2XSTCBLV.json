In this article, we outline a methodological and practical response to these questions and describe its application through the development of tailored interdisciplinary research methods. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS \u2022 This paper describes research undertaken within an interdisciplinary energy project that is seeking to explore domestic energy consumption and everyday digital media use through the individual and combined lenses of engineering, design, social and computer sciences. \u2022 The paper describes the interdisciplinary application of two methods that were enacted within participants\u2019 homes: the interactive floor plan method; and video ethnography tour and re-enactment methods. \u2022 The benefits of embedding design research in this way are discussed in relation to studying the use of technology in the home and recent research trends in ubiquitous computing.", "venue": "Interact.
