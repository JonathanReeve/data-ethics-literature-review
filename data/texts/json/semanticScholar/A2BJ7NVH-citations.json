When humans work creatively, they do not automatically translate ideas into reality. Instead, the object constantly poses unexpected challenges that must be reflected upon and worked through. Surprisingly, even Marx ignored the temporal dimension of work involving the material world. Through the example of artistic work, this essay illustrates and begins sketching a solution to the threat that automatic society poses to creative work.

Discourses around sustainability pose questions of how we are trying to sustain our world and our central place in it. With these questions in mind, we examine the role of science education for sustainability and as a tool for enacting societal change and interacting with the world responsibly. Science education is particularly concerned with helping learners cultivate tools and develop scientific literacy for understanding and interacting with the world. This is key to the ability of current and future generations to meet the challenge of building and maintaining a sustainable world. Yet, these tools are rooted in anthropocentric and Western ways of understanding our relationships with and in the world, which maintains myths such as the neutrality of digital technology or linear forms of progress. We turn to posthuman perspectives to consider an alternative onto-epistemological stance that decenters human agency and foregrounds the co-constitutive and intra-active nature of the world. We argue that scientific literacy and science education for sustainability can act as channels for our species to move beyond ecological sustainability to an understanding of humanity\u2019s entanglement with the world. Life in all its forms, from micro to macro is about relationships with cultural and natural ecologies. Any changes in these relationships can lead to the sustaining, altering, or threatening of these ecologies.

However, the main unanswered questions about this foreseen transformation are its depth, breadth and timelines. To answer them, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even ignore what various technologies in present-day AI are capable of. Many so-called breakthroughs in AI are associated with highly-cited research papers or good performance in some particular benchmarks. However, research breakthroughs do not directly translate into a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. In this paper, we present a novel exemplar-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (representing their depth in maturity and availability). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI, and identify several categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce a generality dimension, which represents increasing layers of breadth of the technology. These two dimensions lead to the new readiness-vs-generality charts, which show that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies, focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while high TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as exemplars. Finally, we show how the timelines of several AI technology exemplars at different generality layers can help forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for AI.", "venue": "Telematics Informatics", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 166, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1399205325", "name": "Fernando Mart\u00ednez-Plumed"}, {"authorId": "1740615089", "name": "Emilia G\u00f3mez"}, {"authorId": "1398777358", "name": "J.

Our talk about AI includes such possibilities as an all-pervasive Internet of Things or the promise of transcendent machine intelligence; but it also means the organization of data, the enactment of economic, medical, or judicial policies, and even ritual participation of religious robots. Every aspect of such conversation deserves our attention and offers possibilities for scholarly contributions to public life. However narrowly or broadly we specify AI, we change how we think about other material things and the relationships among them. Many AI applications, such as search-and-rescue and factory assembly lines, have straightforward uses in society and tightly constrained values built into them. But such goals of economic efficiency, assisting people, etc. predispose us to seeing ourselves and the world in particular ways. Surveillance AI not only changes how we think about people, through data analysis it offers the possibility of literally changing human perspectives. The more expansive our views of AI become, the more those perspectives impinge upon core meanings of humanity and the world. When we conjure up general-purpose AI and the possibility of human-level and greater-than-human intelligence in machines, suddenly the impact of such technologies goes well beyond the mundane, and typically into the realm of the religious. Such views of AI continuously recreate or reinterpret religious bodies of human and divine beings. As is well-known, traditional religious ideas about humanity and divine powers have marched hand-in-hand with the development of AI. Pioneers in AI were sometimes steeped in\u2014and often remarked upon\u2014the golem narratives of medieval Judaism (Wiener 1964; Foerst 2004, 38-41), and that tradition persists into the twenty-first century (Rappaport 2006). But AI is certainly not uniquely attached to Jewish theological traditions. The most obvious contemporary to the warp and weft of golem/AI has been the Buddhist and Shinto traditions frequently tied to robotics in Japan (Schodt 1988; Mori [1981] 1999; Hornyak 2006, 29-32; Kimura 2018). But of course there is nothing necessarily Buddhist about Japanese robotics; nor is there even anything necessarily robotic about Japanese culture (\u0160abanovi\u0107 2014). The intersection of religion and robotics changes across space and time; but rarely do cultural perspectives on the possibility of machine intelligence stray far from religion. Such connections require deliberate choice on the part of human actors. Dr. Frankenstein triumphantly declares \u201cnow I know what it feels like to be God!\u201d in the film adaptation of Mary Shelley\u2019s masterpiece, a perspective echoed by scientists and engineers who later utilized AI. The apotheosis of the programmer as designer of life or even as creator of new gods appears among artificial life programmers (Helmreich [1998] 2000, 83-85, 193), videogame designers (Bartle [2003] 2004, 247), and tech innovators (Kurzweil 2005). They follow in the footsteps of Stewart Brand, whose Whole Earth Catalog famously declared \u201cWe are as Gods and we might as well get good at it.\u201d But few roboticists or programmers who honestly appraise their creations have just cause to celebrate their divine powers. The shortcomings of contemporary AI are sufficient to force both advocates and critics to declare that the machines will have to do the heavy lifting\u2014supposedly we will get them just smart enough to start designing themselves in an ever-improving iterative process until humanity is rendered obsolete or joins the machines in a future of cyborg enhancements and, eventually, uploaded minds. Frankenstein never quite made it to divinity and religious people have yet to attain the transcendent reconfiguration of the world promised in apocalyptic worldviews.

Special attention is paid to the promotion of the ideology of design think[1]ing and the movement for the humanitarization of engineering education. Both gained a consider[1]able popularity in the last quarter of the twentieth century. However, in modern conditions, the relationship between technological progress and the development of human society is taking on new forms that require new answers. There are also new risks \u2013 in particular, the risk of complete de[1]humanization of technological progress and the unclear prospect of the formation of a so-called post-human civilization. Social assessment of technology and the development of value-based tech[1]nologies are possible answers. They have received a very significant support in the United States and Western Europe. In particular, several European conferences on this topic have already been held within the EU (the latest one took place in Bratislava in 2019). However, due to some features of the Russian intellectual tradition, as well as the pronounced techno-optimism of mass consciousness, the Russian academic environment has not yet shown sufficient interest to implant these approaches in technical education. The possibility of managing the current technological progress on the basis of a dialogue with civil society, which is popular in the European Union, is also not considered in Russian intellectual environments. At the same time, the leading technical universities in Russia are gradually developing a network of enthusiasts who are studying the European practice of social assessment of technology and its adaptation to Russian conditions.

Because an industry\u2019s success in innovation depends on complementary innovations among its input suppliers, rapid productivity growth in just a subset of sectors may create bottlenecks and fail to translate into commensurate aggregate productivity gains. Using data on input-output linkages, citation linkages, industry productivity growth and patenting, we find evidence in support of this hypothesis: the variance of supplier TFP growth or innovation adversely affects an industry\u2019s own TFP growth and innovation. Our estimates suggest that a substantial share of the productivity slowdown in the US and several other industrialized economies can be accounted for by the sizable increase in cross-industry variance of TFP growth and innovation. For example, if the TFP growth variance had remained at the same level as between 1977 and 1987, the US manufacturing productivity would have grown twice as fast in 1997-2007 as it did, reaching a higher level of growth than in 1977-1987 and 1987-1997.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2660799", "name": "D.

Matlock also explores data seemly suggestive of reincarnation and attempts to develop a theory of reincarnation that can account for the data collected by parapsychological investigators and researchers.

Neuroscience defines its discourse in relationship to the materiality of the brain \u2013 something that is present \u2013 whereas one of the defining features of psychoanalysis is its relationship to problematic forms of absence, namely, unconscious mental processes. One central concern in this regard is the proposition of unconscious mental processes as a wish-fulfillment. In this paper, the logic of the unconscious as a wish-fulfillment is mobilized as a type of knowledge having significant value for understanding neuroscience as a social and historical community. From this perspective, one of the central problems of neuroscience, the \u201chard problem of consciousness,\u201d is framed not as a problem of neurological correlation but of problematic experience itself. This reframing of the hard problem of consciousness suggests that in order to bring neuroscience and psychoanalysis together, theorists need to think principles of absence. This can be explored with the metaphysics of absence, where indeterminacy and incompleteness become central, and also in the psychoanalytic formulation of the death drive, where we reach the limit of conscious mastery and control. From this foundation, neuroscience and psychoanalysis may find productive dialogue in constructing an \u201cabsential science\u201d which would allow a space for new theory of the human relationship to sex (libido) and death (mortality). This paper argues that such new theory is necessary because the future development of neuroscientific technologies could transform fundamental experiences of absence which structure subjective discourse.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 120, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40221355", "name": "C.

In this understanding, neither the digital humanities, the biohumanities, nor the posthumanities sit outside of biodigitalism. Instead, posthumanism is but one form of biodigitalism that mediates the biohumanities and the digital humanities, no longer preoccupied with the tradition of the subject, but with the constellation of forces shaping the future of human ontologies.

From the traditionalist point of view, the confrontation between the teachings of humanism and traditional religions is shown, as a spiritual confrontation of various religious teachings. The main spiritual and political processes in the modern world are revealed: the process of purposeful destruction of traditional values, religions and cultures and the process of reviving traditional values, religions and cultures in order to preserve the \u201cblooming complexity\u201d, i.e., the civilizational diversity of the world community. In the first process, on the basis of numerous data, shows the struggle of the supporters of the religious-philosophical doctrine of humanism with traditional religious teachings, especially Christianity, and the main task of this struggle provided dechristianization of man and society, because the Christian faith is the basis of the locomotive of world history, European civilization. The main goal of this struggle is to replace Christianity and the traditional world religions with the religion of man-God, i.e., humanism and rationalism. The author reveals the meaning of the concept of transhumanism: the creation of an artificial, unified, fully controlled world populated by biological objects without individuality or any personal characteristics at all. Thus, the ant-human essence of the religion of man-god is revealedthe destruction of the \u201cnatural man\u201d. The article presents the main essential features of the second spiritual-political process, which is opposite to the first one. On the basis of numerous sociological studies, it is proved that in general, there is a noticeable increase in traditional religiosity and the importance of traditional religions in the world. The strengthening of the role of traditional religions and religious organizations in the life of society, especially Orthodoxy and the Russian Orthodox Church, is also recorded in Russia. At the same time, the article notes the contradictory nature of both processes, the confrontation of which is still far from complete. As a result of the analysis, three main conclusions are made. First, in the future, those peoples and civilizations whose spiritual roots will be the strongest will remain and will determine world politics, and traditional spiritual meanings and values will continue to be significant for the majority of members of a particular community. Second, those nations and civilizations that will continue to be in a state of spiritual impoverishment and, as a result, will finally lose their own spiritual sovereignty will be the losers, even to the point of complete disappearance. Third, the rejection of traditional religions, meanings and values in favor of the religion of man-god can lead humanity to the physical disappearance and replacement of \u201cnatural man\u201d with \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 1, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1393205858", "name": "\u0421. \u0412. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "793ded258635c6cff885a94a7f80ced4603c59d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3199555944", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-79689-1_12"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/793ded258635c6cff885a94a7f80ced4603c59d8", "title": "Defining Characteristics of Future Pentecostal Colleges and Universities", "abstract": null, "venue": "Christianity and Renewal - Interdisciplinary Studies", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1711697537", "name": "Daniel Topf"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "7988483b15e7038fffd077094583a0499f1e392a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3084378037", "DOI": "10.4324/9781003003465-3"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7988483b15e7038fffd077094583a0499f1e392a", "title": "Epistemic Autonomy and Externalism", "abstract": "The philosophical significance of attitudinal autonomy\u2014viz., the autonomy of attitudes such as beliefs\u2014is widely discussed in the literature on moral responsibility and free will.

The degree of freedom seems to be very limited. Artistic agency and creativity, on the other hand, rely on openness, freedom, and qualitative experiences. Such experiences are not only vital to artistic expression but also to everyday life. Technological lifeworlds as they are represented through current technologies (e.g. smart homes or automated driving) and science fiction do not seem to accommodate such open structures. The philosophy of technology is divided: Many hold that to a large extent technology determines human cognition (such as Mark B.N. Hansen, Bernard Stiegler) and thus subordinate human cognition to mechanical organizations. Others take a different approach and reflect on the creative potential of new technologies (e.g. Erin Manning, Jaime del Val). This article discusses theories that address the humanmachine relationship as complex structures that go beyond the dystopian idea of humans being transcended or incorporated by technology. Such approaches are central to the discussion on the future of human beings and culturalpolitical shaping of life-worlds. To understand how humanmachine relationships can be framed as open and creative processes, I present epistemological accounts of embodied cognition, artistic examples of performance strategies with algorithmic set-ups, and finally embed these aspects within a broader picture of conceptualizing technology and human life as a continuum rather than standing in opposition or being determined by the other.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 37, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "150347721", "name": "Y.

Criticisms to evolutionary psychology challenge its defense of a notion of a fixed human nature, and its disregard for the experience of birth. Some female scholars link human evolution to the presence of premature infants requiring attention from mothers and alloparents. They explain why this gave an advantage to the human species, enhancing cooperation and other desirable traits. Other scholars develop philosophies of birth, mostly based on Arendt's conception of natality, questioning a human nature not sensitive to gender, excluding birth and childhood. Then we move to transhumanism, proponent of human enhancement. Transhumanism questions our biological inheritance for being flawed and outdated, including giving birth, restricting this to a source of great suffering.

The novel tells the story of the suicide of the last Nobel Prize laureate in the future history of literature, Chinese poet Yuwen Wanghu. Following the detective thread of the book, the essay reconstructs utopian and dystopian semi-virtual landscapes of the mid-21st century China which feed into two different models of lyricism: the poet as a knight errant who seeks inspiration far from modern civilization and the poet as a lonely warrior against (technological) tyranny. In the final scene, the two landscapes blur and the antithetical forces that infuse them: lyricism (Yuwen) and power/ knowledge (the King) merge into what may be seen as their dialectical synthesis to be fulfilled by the novel\u2019s third protagonist \u2013 Yuwen\u2019s young friend, Li Pulei. Mobilizing various contexts, including the suicides of famous mainland-Chinese poets, important poetry polemics, and intertexts ranging from classical Chinese literary theory through to Truman Show and Matrix, I argue that the novel mirrors the development of poetry discourse in the PRC with its various myths, conflicts, complexes, and ambitions.

Towards history- and culture-aware morality model with application in automatic moral reasoning", "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we focus on ethical education as a means to improve artificial companion\u2019s conceptualization of moral decision-making process in human users. In particular, we focus on automatically determining whether changes in ethical education influenced core moral values in humans throughout the century. We analyze ethics as taught in Japan before WWII and today to verify how much the pre-WWII moral attitudes have in common with those of contemporary Japanese, to what degree what is taught as ethics in school overlaps with the general population\u2019s understanding of ethics, as well as to verify whether a major reform of the guidelines for teaching the school subject of \u201cethics\u201d at school after 1946 has changed the way common people approach core moral questions (such as those concerning the sacredness of human life). We selected textbooks used in teaching ethics at school from between 1935 and 1937, and those used in junior high schools today (2019) and analyzed what emotional and moral associations such contents generated. The analysis was performed with an automatic moral and emotional reasoning agent and based on the largest available text corpus in Japanese as well as on the resources of a\u00a0Japanese\u00a0digital library. As a result, we found out that, despite changes in stereotypical view on Japan\u2019s moral sentiments, especially due to historical events, past and contemporary Japanese share a similar moral evaluation of certain basic moral concepts, although there is a large discrepancy between how they perceive some actions to be beneficial to the society as a whole while at the same time being inconclusive when it comes to assessing the same action\u2019s outcome on the individual performing them and in terms of emotional consequences. Some ethical categories, assessed positively before the war, while being associated with a nationalistic trend in education have also disappeared from the scope of interest of post- war society. The findings of this study support suggestions proposed by others that the development of personal AI systems requires supplementation with moral reasoning. Moreover, the paper builds upon this idea and further suggests that AI systems need to be aware of ethics not as a constant, but as a function with a correction on historical and cultural changes in moral reasoning.", "venue": "Cognitive Systems Research", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 4, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1394971799", "name": "Jagna Nieuwazny"}, {"authorId": "101671931", "name": "Karol Nowakowski"}, {"authorId": "1731034", "name": "M.

NAO is a humanoid bipedal robot designed to participate in football competitions against humans by 2050, and speed is crucial for football sports. Therefore, the focus of the paper is on improving NAO speed. This paper is aimed at testing the hypothesis of whether the humanoid NAO walking speed can be improved without changing its physical configuration. The applied research method compares three classification techniques: artificial neural network (ANN), Na\u00efve Bayes, and decision tree to measure and predict NAO\u2019s best walking speed, then select the best method, and enhance it to find the optimal average velocity speed. According to Aldebaran documentation, the real NAO\u2019s robot default walking speed is 9.52\u2009cm/s. The proposed work was initiated by studying NAO hardware platform limitations and selecting Nao\u2019s gait 12 parameters to measure the accuracy metrics implemented in the three classification models design. Five experiments were designed to model and trace the changes for the 12 parameters. The preliminary NAO\u2019s walking datasets open-source available at GitHub, the NAL, and RoboCup datasheets are implemented. All generated gaits\u2019 parameters for both legs and feet in the experiments were recorded using the Choregraphe software. This dataset was divided into 30% for training and 70% for testing each model. The recorded gaits\u2019 parameters were then fed to the three classification models to measure and predict NAO\u2019s walking best speed. After 500 training cycles for the Na\u00efve Bayes, the decision tree, and ANN, the RapidMiner scored 48.20%, 49.87%, and 55.12%, walking metric speed rate, respectively. Next, the emphasis was on enhancing the ANN model to reach the optimal average velocity walking speed for the real NAO. With 12 attributes, the maximum accuracy metric rate of 65.31% was reached with only four hidden layers in 500 training cycles with a 0.5 learning rate for the best walking learning process, and the ANN model predicted the optimal average velocity speed of 51.08% without stiffness: \n \n V\n 1\n =\n 22.62\n \u2009\n cm\n /\n s\n \n , \n \n V\n 2\n =\n 40\n \u2009\n cm\n /\n s\n \n , and \n \n V\n =\n 30\n \u2009\n cm\n /\n s\n \n .

Whereas human resources analytics has been largely discussed in literature in the last decade, a systematic identification and classification of key topics is yet to be introduced. In particular, there is room for conceptual contributions aiming to provide a comprehensive definition of concepts and investigation areas related to HR analytics. Using a systematic literature review process, we deconstruct the concept of human resources analytics as presented in a vast although fragmented literature, and we identify 106 key research topics associated to three major areas, i.e. enablers of HR analytics (technological and organizational), applications (descriptive and diagnostic/prescriptive), and value (employee value and organizational value). We also speculate on an \u201cexponential\u201d view of HR analytics enabled by the affirmation of artificial intelligence and cognitive technologies. The article provides a large systematization effort and a research agenda for developing further studies in the field of HR analytics. By a practitioner perspective, the study offers insights to support the design of innovative analytics projects within organizations.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 139, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2833659", "name": "A.

DITTO serves as a useful mnemonic to help managers recall specific ways to support Gen Zers and leverages the strengths of Gen Zers to benefit the organization and the workforce. Research shows that Gen Zers bring unique characteristics to the workplace, such as being more open to diversity and more individualistic and technology-driven than other generations.

Nevertheless, in many ways, what this class of technologies has offered as return on investment remains less impressive than what has been promised. In the present paper, we argue that the continued failure to realize the potential in modern AI and AI-related technologies is largely attributable to the oversimplified, yet pervasive ways that our global society treats the relationship between these technologies and humans. Oversimplified concepts, once conveyed, tend to perpetuate myths that in turn limit the impact of such technologies in human society. To counter these oversimplifications, we offer a theoretical construct, which we call the landscape of human-AI partnership. This construct characterizes individual capability for real-world task performance as a dynamic function of information certainty, available time to respond, and task complexity. With this, our goal is to encourage more nuanced discourse about novel ways to solve challenges to modern and future sociotechnical societies, but without defaulting to notions that remain rooted in today\u2019s technologies-as-tools ways of thinking. The core of our argument is that society at large must recognize that intelligent technologies are evolving well beyond being mere tools for human use and are instead becoming capable of operating as interdependent teammates. This means that how we think about interactions between humans and AI needs to go beyond a \u201cHuman\u2013or\u2013AI\u201d conversation about task assignments to more contextualized \u201cHuman\u2013and\u2013AI\u201d way of thinking about how best to capitalize on the strengths hidden within emergent capabilities of unique human-AI partnerships that have yet to be fully realized.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 148, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "7525414", "name": "J.

Von einer anf\u00e4nglichen Euphorie in den 1950er Jahren ging es wellenf\u00f6rmig durch H\u00f6hen und Tiefen: War man zu Beginn recht optimistisch, mit logischen, symbolischen Verfahren Probleme wie maschinelles \u00dcbersetzen, Bildund Textverstehen oder Robotersteuerung innerhalb weniger Jahrzehnte zu l\u00f6sen, musste man schlie\u00dflich diese anf\u00e4nglichen Vorstellungen nachjustieren.

Danach folgte eine Periode der Ern\u00fcchterung, der sogenannte KI-Winter. Die \u00f6ffentlichen Forschungsgelder wurden zur\u00fcckgefahren, viele der gro\u00dfen Projekte, so etwa das japanische 5th Generation Project oder das europ\u00e4ische ESPRIT Programm wurden nicht weiterverfolgt. Diese Haltung \u00e4nderte sich allm\u00e4hlich, als 1997 ein Computer den damals amtierenden Schachweltmeister besiegte und 2011 das IBM-System Watson in der Quizshow Jeopardy gegen menschliche Champions gewann.

However, as argued in the article, negative dialectics of emancipation must also be problematized. The project of emancipation, as it was formulated in the Age of Enlightenment, was often particular and was associated with the establishment of new forms of domination. Especially the project of liberation from the constraints of nature through technical development led to the domination of nature.

While many researchers believe that Technological Singularity is at an arm\u2019s length, many counter-question the possibility of the same due to the lack of concrete evidence. Recently Cybersecurity has manoeuvred its way through technology to become one of the most rapidly advancing fields. Artificial Intelligence introduced to Cybersecurity has seen a tremendous increase in the number of systems that are capable of performing tasks faster and better than humans. This has led us to believe that there is intelligence in cyberspace along with the possibility of Cyber Singularity. We emphasise the intelligence of systems using a set of characteristics that insist on how sophisticated the systems have become over time that might lead to Cyber Singularity. We map these characteristics to the characteristics of living species with the hope of locating intelligence in the biomedical domain and further, try to identify systems displaying such characteristics in cyberspace. Keeping in mind the concept of technological singularity proposed before, we also perform an extensive survey of the past research works related to the field and also, use the concepts of set theory to reinforce the possibility of Cyber Singularity in the coming years.", "venue": "J.

The development procedure represents a Design Science Research approach including a systematic literature review, a qualitative survey with audit experts and an iterative development process.", "venue": "ECIS", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 90, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2111965685", "name": "Philipp Fukas"}, {"authorId": "3364863", "name": "Jonas Rebstadt"}, {"authorId": "146743228", "name": "Florian Remark"}, {"authorId": "145589040", "name": "Oliver Thomas"}]}}, {"contexts": ["\u2026via its internet appearances, e.g., the transhumanist party (www.transhumanist-party.org), Humanity+ (humanityplus.org), Extropianism (http://www. extropy.org/, an institute founded by Max More and Natasha Vita-More), Democratic Transhumanism (Hughes, 2004), or Singularity (Kurzweil, 2005).", "Furthermore, the transhumanist movement has disseminated its objectives (The Transhumanist Declaration, Various, 2013) worldwide via its internet appearances, e.g., the transhumanist party (www.transhumanist-party.org), Humanity+ (humanityplus.org), Extropianism (http://www. extropy.org/, an institute founded by Max More and Natasha Vita-More), Democratic Transhumanism (Hughes, 2004), or Singularity (Kurzweil, 2005).", "org/, an institute founded by Max More and Natasha Vita-More), Democratic Transhumanism (Hughes, 2004), or Singularity (Kurzweil, 2005)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "f0fc632faa0d65e2cdbabadad4cd296bd17a112f", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8112819", "DOI": "10.3389/fsoc.2021.651486", "PubMed": "33987221"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0fc632faa0d65e2cdbabadad4cd296bd17a112f", "title": "TechnoBrainBodies-in-Cultures: An Intersectional Case", "abstract": "The cyborgization of brainbodies with computer hardware and software today ranges in scope from the realization of Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to visions of mind upload to silicon, the latter being targeted toward a transhuman future. Refining posthumanist concepts to formulate a posthumanities perspective, and contrasting those approaches with transhumanist trajectories, I explore the intersectional dimension of realizations and visions of neuro-technological developments, which I name TechnoBrainBodies-in-Cultures. In an intersectional analysis, I investigate the embedding and legitimation of transhumanist visions brought about by neuroscientific research and neuro-technological development based on a concept of modern neurobiological determinism. The conjoined trajectories of BCI research and development and transhumanist visions perpetuate the inscription of intersectional norms, with the concomitant danger of producing discriminatory effects. This culminates in normative capacity being seen as a conflation of the abled, successful, white masculinized techno-brain with competition. My deeper analysis, however, also enables displacements within recent BCI research and development to be characterized: from \u2018\u2018thought-translation\u201d to affective conditioning and from controllability to obstinacy within the BCI, going so far as to open the closed loop. These realizations challenge notions about the BCI's actor status and agency and foster questions about shifts in the corresponding subject\u2013object relations. Based on these analyses, I look at the effects of neuro-technological and transhumanist governmentality on the question of whose lives are to be improved and whose lives should be excluded from these developments. Within the framework of political feminist materialisms, I combine the concept of posthumanities with my concept of TechnoBrainBodies-in-Cultures to envision and discuss a material-discursive strategy, encompassing dimensions of affect, sociality, resistance, compassion, cultural diversity, ethnic diversity, multiple sexes/sexualities, aging, dis/abilities\u2014in short, all of this \u201cintersectional stuff\u201d\u2014as well as obstinate techno-brain agencies and contumacies foreseen in these cyborgian futures.", "venue": "Frontiers in Sociology", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 149, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "32419130", "name": "S.

As a Think Piece in Analytics, it engages in a somewhat experimental comparative endeavor as I set concepts from the ethnographic field of transhumanism in a comparative relation to concepts developed in the anthropological theory of Christianity, mainly Dumont\u2019s concept of the \u2018individual-in-the-world\u2019. I argue that through such a comparison we can understand recently developed ideas about the (technologically) immortal human being in a new light. The article points to how technoscientific immortality echoes core cultural themes, but it also considers a major difference in the perception of the social. When death is made redundant, the question of how sociality is reproduced moves center stage.", "venue": "Social Analysis", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "50714757", "name": "A.
