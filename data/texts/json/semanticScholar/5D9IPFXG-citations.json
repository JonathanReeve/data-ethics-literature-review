The automated decision-making by artificial intelligence algorithms already has a significant impact on society as a whole. AI has become a situation where we must consider how it can coexist with humans beyond the icon of the times.

Recent studies on future employment discuss whether growth in computer power and advances in artificial intelligence enable the automation of non-routine tasks, including tasks that require creativity and innovation, which are among the most unique human capacities. However, this discussion generally lacks research-based concepts of creativity and innovation. In order to clarify the discussion on the division of labor, relevant theories of creativity and innovation are introduced. The inquiry shows that creativity and innovation consist in making new connections between domains or practices. While computers and robotics are capable of operating only within specific domains, in which rules apply or data are available, creativity and innovation operate beyond the boundaries of such domains and must be guided by emotions and driven by moods. This suggests that computers and robotics make rapid change possible, but cannot solve the task of creating change themselves.

A.I. is widely perceived as a significant emerging and future-shaping technological field that is developing at an accelerating rate. As such, futuristic imagery involving A.I. is increasingly prevalent in popular media. A central task for critical future studies is to assess both positive and problematic aspects of the futuristic scenarios offered up for public consumption, and to evaluate their role as part of a \u2018futural public sphere\u2019 (Goode & Godhe 2017). In this paper, I discuss three distinct but interwoven strands of public discourse that each have a role to play in shaping the popular imagination around possible A.I. futures. I begin with a selective discussion of mainstream science fiction represenations. Secondly, I consider several recent and high-profile popular media events surrounding real-world developments in A.I.

In this step relevant trends are identified and placed in a broader 'meta'-perspective of a three layered framework, whereby different layers relate to trends of varying inertia (or duration). This multi-layered approach results in a sharper view of the future, which narrows down the \u2018plausible\u2019 future space. The second step concerns a new approach in which trend based narratives are used to identify threats and opportunities for the port. The insights from the three layered trend analysis are translated into sixteen well-structured storylines or \u2018narratives\u2019, that take the strengths and weaknesses of the port of Rotterdam as a starting point and thus address threats and opportunities specific to the port. The narratives indicate which activities are likely to claim scarce space in the port over the next two decades. They help to form ideas about a future-proof clustering of activities, the required space in the port, as well as the required infrastructure and utilities.

Aspects of shame, narcissism and social rank have all been associated with distress and wellbeing in adolescence, however no studies to date have investigated the impact of those constructs together in terms of their predictive value. Extant research has identified self-compassion as protective and associated with increased wellbeing. \nAims: This study aimed to explore the relationships between external, internal and shame proneness; grandiose and vulnerable narcissism; social comparison and submissive behaviour, and self-compassion; and to explore the impact of \nthose variables and the relationships between them upon psychological distress and wellbeing. \nMethod: From the pragmatist approach this study adopted a cross-sectional, quantitative approach. Mid-adolescents aged 16-17 (N=142) were recruited and invited to complete a battery of self-report questionnaires via school or online \nsurvey. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to explore relationships and predictive associations between the variables and moderation analysis was performed to test the effects of self-compassion on the regression models. \nResults: This population was found to be low in wellbeing and moderate in distress. Multiple regression analyses found distress was predicted by internal shame, shame proneness, submissive behaviour and vulnerable narcissism; \nwellbeing was predicted by shame proneness; submissive behaviour and vulnerable narcissism (negatively) and social comparison and grandiose narcissism (positively). Self-compassion did not correlate with or predict distress, however its predictive power on wellbeing was marked. Moderation analyses showed self-compassion does not moderate distress or wellbeing. \nConclusion: These novel findings suggest two predictive models for shame, narcissism and social rank in distress and wellbeing for an adolescent population, and show the impact of self-compassion. A more selfcompassionate attitude was related to increased wellbeing, hence those high in distress could benefit from compassion-based interventions and educational initiatives.

Search engines have been studied in various disciplines, for example information retrieval, computer science, law, and new media, yet much of this work remains fixed within disciplinary boundaries. The approach of this thesis is to draw on work from a number of areas in order to link a technical understanding of how search engines function with a wider cultural and philosophical context. In particular, this thesis draws on critical theory in order to attend to the convergence of language, programming, and culture on a global scale. The chapter outline is as follows. Chapter one compares search engine queries to traditional questions. The chapter draws from information retrieval research to provide a technical framework that is brought into contact with philosophy and critical theory, including Plato and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Chapter two investigates search engines as memory aids, deploying a history of memory and exploring practices within oral cultures and mnemonic techniques such as the Ars Memoria. This places search engines within a longer historical context, while drawing on contemporary insights from the philosophy and science of cognition. Chapter three addresses Google\u2019s Autocomplete functionality and chapter four explores the contextual nature of results in order to highlight how different characteristics of users are used to personalise access to the web. These chapters address Google\u2019s role within a global context and the implications for identity and community online. Finally, chapter five explores how Google\u2019s method of generating revenue, through advertising, has a social impact on the web as a whole, particularly when considered through the lens of contemporary Post-Fordist accounts of capitalism.
