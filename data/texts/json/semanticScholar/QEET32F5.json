There have been few efforts thus far, though, to connect these developments to potentially relevant bodies of existing theory and research. This article seeks to address this gap by exploring the utility of institutional theory as a potentially useful analytical framework for continued inquiry into the role of algorithms in the operation of media systems, and by offering some suggestions for ways in which an institutional analytical frame can be extended into algorithmic contexts.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 115, "citationCount": 191, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39277002", "name": "Philip M.
