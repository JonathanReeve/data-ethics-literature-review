To address this need we introduce value scenarios, an extension of scenario-based design which can support envisioning the systemic effects of new technologies. We identify and describe five key elements of value scenarios; stakeholders, pervasiveness, time, systemic effects, and value implications. We provide two examples of value scenarios, which draw from our current work on urban simulation and human-robotic interaction . We conclude with suggestions for how value scenarios might be used by others.", "venue": "CHI Extended Abstracts", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 11, "citationCount": 74, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "34869420", "name": "L.
