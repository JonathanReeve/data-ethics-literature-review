Drawing on extensive archival research, participant observation and interviews, this article explores the ways in which Burning Man's bohemian ethos supports new forms of production emerging in Silicon Valley and especially at Google. It shows how elements of the Burning Man world \u2014 including the building of a sociotechnical commons, participation in project-based artistic labor and the fusion of social and professional interaction \u2014 help to shape and legitimate the collaborative manufacturing processes driving the growth of Google and other firms. The article develops the notion that Burning Man serves as a key cultural infrastructure for the Bay Area's new media industries.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 66, "citationCount": 136, "influentialCitationCount": 10, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1391176956", "name": "Fred Turner"}]}
