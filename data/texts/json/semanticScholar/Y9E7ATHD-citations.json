Over the past decade a growing corpus of publications spanning Social Sciences and Computer Science/HCI have empirically examined the nature of work practices and tasks within crowdwork; surfaced key individual and environmental factors underpinning workers\u2019 decisions to engage in this form of work; developed and implemented tools to improve and extend various aspects of crowdwork, such as the design and allocation of tasks and incentives or workflows within the platforms; and contributed new techniques and know-how on data collection within crowdwork, for example, how to conduct large-scale surveys and experiments in behavioural psychology, economics or education drawing on crowdworker samples. Our initial reading of the crowdwork literature suggested that research had relied on a limited set of relatively narrow methodological approaches, mostly online experiments, surveys and interviews. Importantly, crowdwork research has tended to examine workers\u2019 experiences as snapshots in time rather than studying these longitudinally or contextualising them historically, environmentally and developmentally. This piece-meal approach has given the research community initial descriptions and interpretations of crowdwork practices and provided an important starting point in a nascent field of study. However, the depth of research in the various areas, and the missing pieces, have yet to be systematically scoped out. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews the analytical-methodological approaches used in crowdwork research identifying gaps in these approaches. We argue that to take crowdwork research to the next level it is essential to examine crowdwork practices within the context of both individual and historical-environmental factors impacting it. To this end, methodological approaches that bridge sociological, psychological, individual, collective, online, offline, and temporal processes and practices of crowdwork are needed. The paper proposes the Life Course perspective as an interdisciplinary framework that can help address these gaps and advance research on crowdwork. The paper concludes by proposing a set of Life Course-inspired research questions to guide future studies of crowdwork.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 133, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144394172", "name": "A.

Making use of a structural estimation model of labour market dynamics, we estimate differences in market power that workers face depending on their sector of activity, their age and educational level. In particular, we show that differences in cross-sectional market power are significant and higher than variations over the ten-year time span of our data. In contrast to findings of labour market power in developed countries, we document significant market power of employers vis-a-vis the tertiary educated workforce, regardless of age and sector. In contrast, for the primary educated workforce, market power seems to be high in (private) services and manufacturing. For secondary educated workers, only the mining sector stands out as moderately more monopsonistic than the rest of the labour market. We also show that at least for the 2010s, the market power remained broadly stable in Peru. We contrast these findings with similar estimates obtained for the United States where we are able to show that it is mostly the less educated workforce that faces market power. Moreover, we show that for the US, the labour market power has gradually increased over the past ten years, in line with the general rise in inequality, but mostly for those with short labour market tenure. We also discuss possible reasons for these findings, including for the differences of labour market power across skill levels.

Examining Urban Impressions in Global South Cities", "abstract": "While the study of how people perceive urban environments according to subjective dimensions like beauty and danger is a classic topic in environmental psychology, only in recent years computing research has addressed these questions with an interest in machine recognition of such kinds of urban impressions. In this chapter, we describe some of the basic concepts related to this emerging domain, which is at the intersection of computing and human perception. Then, with a specific focus on Global South cities, we present a study on perception of urban scenes by people and machines. The study is conducted on a dataset of 1,200 images collected in threeMexican cities of different characteristics and six urban impression variables. First, we conduct a comparative analysis of crowdsourced impressions generated by local and non-local observers. The analysis shows that non-local observers reach higher inter-observer agreement compared to local ones, and that these two groups tend to disagree onwhat they report to perceivewith respect to dimensions like danger and interest. Second, we show that visual cues extracted from deep neural networks and trained with impression labels provided by both local and non-local observers result in systems for which non-local judgments are better inferred that local ones. Based on these findings, the chapter discusses implications for the design of systems that use crowdsourced subjective labels for machine learning and inference on urban environments.

What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of their time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to $2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.", "venue": "Proc.

The case of Dutch self-employed service professionals", "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to study what platform-related user factors influence the employment potential of a lean platform for self-employed professionals.,The article employs the system data of a Dutch platform firm, which include consumers looking for painters (N\u00a0=\u00a017,224) and self-employed painters (N\u00a0=\u00a01,752) who pursue client acquisition by submitting proposals (N\u00a0=\u00a0101,974). This data is analysed using non-parametric tests.,Study of this platform shows that the platform functions as a channel of acquisition for self-employed professionals. This lean platform enables matching of information of supply and demand, thereby facilitating processes of acquisition. The number of competitors, distance to a potential job and non-standard proposals are statistically significant factors that influence whether a consumer is interested in a proposal. Effect sizes are very small.,This platform is a two-way market for information about service jobs, which excludes a price setting mechanism. The findings of this study cannot be generalized to other forms of platforms.,The market for service professionals is very local; therefore, the platform firm may alter the algorithm to accommodate this. Self-employed professionals should approach using the platform in the same way as normal forms of acquisition.,This particular type of two-sided market is an extension of regular forms of acquisition by creating \u201cweak ties\u201d through the platform.,The article uses a unique data set to study the impact and limitations of digitalization of the (labour) market for service professionals.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 70, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1448454360", "name": "Paul Jonker-Hoffr\u00e9n"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "b45bb776356b683eb89838f236077ca578dcf110", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-14622-1_82"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b45bb776356b683eb89838f236077ca578dcf110", "title": "The Future of Work, Digital Labor, and Business Legitimacy", "abstract": null, "venue": "Handbook of Business Legitimacy", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Sut I.

We show that these conditions are largely due to the disruptive nature of the process of digitising the employee\u2013employer relationship. Digitisation replaces the employment contract of the standard employment relationship with a triangular \u201cworker\u2013platform\u2013customer\u201d relationship. In this model, the boundaries of the employment relationship become opaque and more uncertain: the bond of subordination disappears, labour law gives way to commercial law, and the figures of the employer and the employee lose institutional visibility. The article seeks to clarify the contours of this \u201cin-between\u201d model and proposes the notion of the \u201cgrey zone,\u201d borrowed from geopolitics. This notion of the \u201cemployment grey zone\u201d makes it possible to shift the researcher's perspective by focusing attention on practices and \u201cintermediate spaces of regulation,\u201d which are relatively autonomous and endowed with their own dynamics. This framework of analysis broadens the perspective and helps to better understand the impact on the employment relationship of new forms of governance in a context of a digital turning point. The article first returns to the notion of the \u201cgrey zone\u201d and argues on the foundations and interest of mobilising this notion in the field of industrial relations studies. The links between digital platforms and grey zones are then examined. In particular, we show that digital governance is based on a confusion of powers between coordination and leadership. The reflection continues in a third phase with an examination of digital management practices in two areas: the control of the activity of connected workers, and the production and management of externalities resulting from the operation of platforms.

Scholars have conceptualized the procedures of control exercised by these platforms as exerting \u201calgorithmic management,\u201d reflecting the use of extensive data collection to feed algorithms that structure work. In this paper, we broaden the attention to algorithmic management and gig-working control in two ways. First, we characterize the managerial functions of Upwork, an online platform that facilitates knowledge-intensive freelance labor - to advance discourse beyond ride-sharing and room-renting labor. Second, we advance the concept of platformic management as a means to convey a broader and sociotechnical premise of these platforms\u2019 functions in structuring work. We draw on data collected from Upwork forum discussions, interviews with gig workers who use Upwork, and a walkthrough analysis of the Upwork platform to develop our analysis. Our findings lead us to articulate platformic management -- extending beyond algorithms -- and to present the platform as a \u201cboundary resource\u201d to illustrate the paradoxical affordances of Upwork and similar labor platforms.

These workers understand the non-linearity of work and working, and are artful in their pursuits around, through and beyond infrastructural givens.

While research has begun to explore segmentation between users and non-users, only limited research has looked at consumer segmentation within sharing economy services. In this paper, we build on this research gap by investigating consumer segmentation within a single sharing economy platform: Airbnb. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, with both a quantitative survey and a qualitative content analysis of Airbnb listings, we compare two different types of accommodation offered on Airbnb: shared room and entire home. Our findings indicate that within a single platform, the variety between offerings can create distinct consumer segments based on both demographics and behavioral criteria. We also find that Airbnb hosts use marketing logic to target their listings towards specific consumer segments. However, there is not, in all cases, strong alignment between consumer segmentation and host targeting, leading to potentially reduced matching efficiency.", "venue": "Journal of Business Research", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 55, "citationCount": 135, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6889723", "name": "C.

In recent years, however, a new narrative has emerged that challenges the role of geography in explaining hiring and wages. This narrative asserts that the global diffusion of high-capacity communication networks and the digitization of work is making location increasingly irrelevant, creating a globally contested market for labor (Blinder 2006). This is the narrative of the \u201cflat world\u201d popularized by, among other sources, Thomas Friedman\u2019s bestseller The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century (2005). According to this narrative, digital work has the potential to drive wage and employment growth in emerging economies through several mechanisms (Raja et al. 2013; Rossotto, Kuek, and Paradi-Guilford 2012). Driven by salary differentials, employers in advanced economies are likely to gravitate toward countries with large pools of lower-cost white-collar workers. Further, online labor platforms significantly reduce problems of spatial mismatch between workers\u2019 abilities and opportunities in local job markets. This increases the returns to skills acquisition, thus unleashing a virtuous cycle of human capital development and job growth in developing regions. Several stylized facts support this narrative. First, most employers in online labor platforms are based in high-income countries, while the majority of workers are based in middleand low-income countries (Agrawal, Lacetera, and Lyons 2013; Graham, Hjorth, and Lehdonvirta 2017).

I briefly draw on the implications of Internet research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for autonomy, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data.

Although it is too soon to give a final assessment of this emerging workplace, we can be sure it will have a significant influence on the labour market, including (labour) law institutions.
