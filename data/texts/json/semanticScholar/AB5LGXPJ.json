The article focuses on disgust because its elicitors have been precisely described. In Study 1, with controls for informational factors like truth, people were more willing to pass along stories that elicited stronger disgust. Study 2 randomly sampled legends and created versions that varied in disgust; people preferred to pass along versions that produced the highest level of disgust. Study 3 coded legends for specific story motifs that produce disgust (e.g., ingestion of a contaminated substance) and found that legends that contained more disgust motifs were distributed more widely on urban legend Web sites. The conclusion discusses implications of emotional selection for the social marketplace of ideas.", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 81, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "36117819", "name": "C.
