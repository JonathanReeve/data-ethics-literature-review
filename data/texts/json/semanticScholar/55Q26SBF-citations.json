The limitations of both consumer awareness and of proactive monitoring strategies can be attributed to their failure to address epistemic fragmentation.

This article examines the schemes and critiques the policy on which they are based. It applies a conceptual framework to assess the optimum conditions for the use of co-regulation and self-regulation. It finds that a self-regulatory scheme of voluntary codes was never a suitable approach for the News Code, and that the close involvement of the regulator on the Disinformation Code \u2014 without a suitable remit or enforcement powers \u2014 distorts the self-regulatory model.

In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer networks that collaboratively evaluated the veracity of news by communicating either binary or probabilistic judgments.

Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations.

Second, travelers have new opportunities to use platforms for travel on their own terms, but this expanded participation is circumscribed by interfaces that presuppose individual, transactional engagement rather than a participation attentive to a broader social and environmental context. Finally, digital systems show themselves to be well suited to enforcing quantifiable distributional goals, but struggle to resolve the more nuanced relational matters that constitute the politics of everyday city life.

The findings leverage variation in organizational contexts to elaborate the common practices and divergent strategies of relationship labor deployed by each platform. Both platforms relied on relationship workers to engage in account management practices aimed at addressing the particular concerns of individual users through interpersonal communications. Relationship workers in each setting also engaged in community management practices that facilitated contact and collaboration among users in pursuit of shared goals. However, our findings show that the relative frequency of relationship workers\u2019 use of account management and community management practices varies with organizational conditions.

Our current focus is the study of constructiveness and evaluation in the comments. To that end, we have annotated a subset of the large corpus (1043 comments) with four layers of annotations: constructiveness, toxicity, negation and Appraisal (Martin and White, The language of evaluation, Palgrave, New York, 2005 ).

Due in no small part to the emergence of digital media, consumer choices have mushroomed, while advertisers understand much more about target audiences.

In this era, what does it mean to \u201cdo media planning\u201d and to do it well? The present article argues for planning decisions to move away from simply purchasing exposure to instead focusing on fostering engagement through meaningful and sustained interactions with consumers. It provides an overview of the digital ecosystem that makes computational advertising possible, updates the notion of consumer engagement for this context, and reviews how measurement becomes more central to media planning decisions.

In addition, results show evidence of a mediation effect. Specifically, moderating all uncivil comments made people more emotionally exhausted, and this exhaustion in turn led people to be less accurate in picking which comments to reject or accept for publication on a news site comment thread. However, moderating comments had no effect on perceptions of flow, an immersive experience, conceptually borne out of the field of positive psychology.

Attempting to scale moderation, social platforms are increasingly adopting automated approaches to suppressing communications that they deem undesirable. However, this brings its own concerns. This paper examines the structural effects of algorithmic censorship by social platforms to assist in developing a fuller understanding of the risks of such approaches to content moderation. This analysis shows that algorithmic censorship is distinctive for two reasons: (1) in potentially bringing all communications carried out on social platforms within reach and (2) in potentially allowing those platforms to take a more active, interventionist approach to moderating those communications. Consequently, algorithmic censorship could allow social platforms to exercise an unprecedented degree of control over both public and private communications. Moreover, commercial priorities would be inserted further into the everyday communications of billions of people. Due to the dominance of the web by a few social platforms, this may be difficult or impractical to escape for many people, although opportunities for resistance do exist.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 122, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "40915668", "name": "Jennifer Cobbe"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "b720ce5376d88ecc3ebd76ac20adc581dc9055b9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2997400962", "DBLP": "journals/pacmhci/JunejaSM20", "DOI": "10.1145/3375197"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b720ce5376d88ecc3ebd76ac20adc581dc9055b9", "title": "Through the Looking Glass", "abstract": "Transparency in moderation practices is crucial to the success of an online community.

But do the moderators of subreddit communities follow these guidelines too? In this paper, we answer this question by employing a mixed-methods approach on public moderation logs collected from 204 subreddits over a period of five months, containing more than 0.5M instances of removals by both human moderators and AutoModerator. Our results reveal a lack of transparency in moderation practices. We find that while subreddits often rely on AutoModerator to sanction newcomer posts based on karma requirements and moderate uncivil content based on automated keyword lists, users are neither notified of these sanctions, nor are these practices formally stated in any of the subreddits' rules. We interviewed 13 Reddit moderators to hear their views on different facets of transparency and to determine why a lack of transparency is a widespread phenomenon. The interviews reveal that moderators' stance on transparency is divided, there is a lack of standardized process to appeal against content removal and Reddit's app and platform design often impede moderators' ability to be transparent in their moderation practices.", "venue": "Proc.

Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye.

Live streaming is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the contemporary landscape around video games, game cultures, and the games industry [34]. Recent research into video game live streaming has explored its financial structures [18], its potential as a platform for self-expression [10], and its novel affordances for communication [12]. However, community guidelines also play a significant, behind-the-scenes role in shaping live streaming practices. These guidelines, which shift over time in response to controversies and changing notions of acceptable behavior, set standards for what types of content can be streamed and how streamers present themselves on-camera. Here we assemble, compare, and interpret the community guidelines of a number of top live streaming sites. Our focus is on how these guidelines construct and regulate \"legitimate\" bodies - both the bodies of streamers and the bodies of in-game characters - especially the sexualized bodies of women. In varying ways, each set of community guidelines attempts to establish rules for how women's bodies may or may not be presented on screen. Often these guidelines measure and quantify the body, for example by dictating precisely how high the neckline of a streamer's shirt must be. Through our analysis, we articulate the unspoken yet active cultural work performed by these community guidelines, which try yet ultimately fail to render a definition of the sexualized body in precise, concrete terms. This research also offers new insights into larger issues of video games and gender. It points toward anxieties about the visibility of women's bodies in gaming spaces and demonstrates that, although live streaming platforms like Twitch present their community guidelines as tools for protecting their community members, these same guidelines often enact the further marginalization of women and other diverse streamers.", "venue": "FDG", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "35415746", "name": "Amanda L.

This article\u2019s aim is to present the project\u2019s conceptual ideas, its interdisciplinary character, its research-based development approach and the concept for a local news platform that grew out of our preliminary work. At each level we focus on the relationality which arises in the figurations of the actors involved and their various perspectives. First, we illustrate how relationality already shaped the objective of our project and how this results in its interdisciplinary structure and research design. We then discuss this idea with reference to our empirical findings, that is, the paradox of the local public sphere: While all the actors we interviewed\u2014those who (professionally) produce content and those who use it\u2014have a high appreciation for the idea of a local public sphere, the mediated connection to this sphere is diminishing at the same time. We understand this as the real challenge for local journalism and the local public sphere at large, and not just for individual media organizations. This is also the reason why we argue for a fundamentally relational approach: from a theoretical point of view, it can be used to grasp the crisis of the local public; from a practical point of view, relationality represents the core characteristic of the platform in development. On this basis, we will then show how the concept of the experimental local news platform evolved through the use of a prototype as a relational boundary object. This development lead to the conceptualization of the platform molo.news which itself is characterized by a fourfold relationality.

However, there have been key successes in the use of these tools for documentation and advocacy in the past decade, including greater participation, more documentation, and growth of new fields around citizen evidence and fact-finding. Governments and others antagonistic to human rights have caught up in terms of weaponizing the affordances of the internet and pushing back on rights actors. Key challenges to be grappled with are consistent with ones that have existed for a decade but are exacerbated now\u2014how to protect and enhance safety of vulnerable people and provide agency over visibility and anonymity; how to ensure and improve trust and credibility of human rights documentation and advocacy campaigning; and how to identify and use new strategies that optimize for a climate of volume of media, declining trust in traditional sources, and active strategies of distraction and misinformation. All of these activities take place primarily within a set of platforms that are governed by commercial imperatives and attention-based algorithms, and that increasingly use unaccountable content moderation processes driven by artificial intelligence. The article argues for a pragmatic approach to harm reduction within the platforms and tools that are used by a diverse range of human rights defenders, and for a proactive engagement on ensuring that an inclusive human rights perspective is centred in responses to new challenges at a global level within a multipolar world as well as specific areas of challenge and opportunity such as fake news and authenticity, deepfakes, use of artificial intelligence to find and make sense of information, virtual reality, and how we ensure effective solidarity activism.

Our findings suggest that the affordances of voice-based online communities change what it means to moderate content and interactions. Not only are there new ways to break rules that moderators of text-based communities find unfamiliar, such as disruptive noise and voice raiding, but acquiring evidence of rule-breaking behaviors is also more difficult due to the ephemerality of real-time voice. While moderators have developed new moderation strategies, these strategies are limited and often based on hearsay and first impressions, resulting in problems ranging from unsuccessful moderation to false accusations.

In addressing questions about Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s processes and policies regarding paid political content, the rationales for them, and the ability of campaigns to contest decisions, this study shows how while Facebook and Google resist being arbiters of political discourse, they actively vet paid content on their platforms. These platforms differ with respect to how and what decisions they make in the context of paid speech and within each company there are active and ongoing debates among staffers about speech. These debates at times take place in consultation with political practitioners and often occur in the context of external events. Across these firms, policies regarding speech evolve through these internal debates, appeals by practitioners, and outside pressure. At the same time, both Facebook and Google make decisions in often opaque ways, according to policies that are not transparent, and without clear justifications to campaigns or the public as to how they are applied or enforced. This limits options for political practitioners to contest regulation decisions.

It is not just a matter of pushing a few buttons\u2014there are elementary structural defects to the very setup. There are two ways to change this: the coercive or the voluntary. The first is often discussed in terms of the increasingly monopolistic behavior of the giants. We have already touched upon their dominant role in the market. The present situation is a far cry from the anarchist\u2014or free-market liberalist\u2014Internet of the 1990s, with its diversity of users and small companies all competing with each other. The dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the millennium and wiped out many of the small firms, helping to usher in the next phase, the 2000s. Here, a few companies gradually gained control of the market, only to become the world\u2019s richest during the 2010s. Scrooge McDuck\u2019s amazing career from shoeshine boy to the richest duck in the world has long been replaced by the story of Mark the Nerd who founded Facebook in his college dorm room in 2004, and long before turning 30 became one of the world\u2019s most wealthy and powerful people. Facebook and Google are approaching a duopoly in the online advertising market based on non-paying users, with Microsoft and Apple bordering on duopoly in the field of software, and finally Amazon with its near-monopoly on Internet trade. The latter is less central to freedom of expression, but still includes a relevant dimension, as the size and market dominance of Amazon has made the company\u2019s bookstore capable of putting unprecedented pressure on its suppliers\u2014the publishing companies. The story of Jeff Bezos is well known, how he saw the enormous possibilities of Internet trading and decided to start from one corner: books. It was an industry of durable, easily transportable goods with a distribution network then dominated by small local players. It turned out to be the perfect place to launch a disruption of trade patterns through e-commerce. Amazon grew explosively and managed in but a few years to establish itself as a key player in the sales and distribution of books in many countries. Among the secrets to the company\u2019s success was placing its headquarters in Seattle, in sparsely populated and remote Washington State, which meant that mail order buyers outside of the state could avoid taxes, allowing Amazon to undercut the prices of local bookstores.

Crowdfunding in its current manifestations can be seen as an antithesis to universal health coverage. But research on medical crowdfunding, particularly in global health contexts, has been sparse, and accessing robust data is difficult. To map and document how medical crowdfunding is shaped by, and shapes, health disparities, this article offers an exploratory conceptual and empirical analysis of medical crowdfunding platforms and practices around the world. Data are drawn from a mixed-methods analysis of medical crowdfunding campaigns, as well as an ongoing ethnographic study of crowdfunding platforms and the people who use them. Drawing on empirical data and case examples, this article describes three main ways that crowdfunding is impacting health equity and health politics around the world: 1) as a technological determinant of health, wherein data ownership, algorithms and platform politics influence health inequities; 2) as a commercial determinant of health, wherein corporate influence reshapes healthcare markets and health data; 3) and as a determinant of health politics, affecting how citizens view health rights and the future of health coverage. Rather than viewing crowdfunding as a social media fad or a purely beneficial technology, researchers and publics must recognize it as a complex innovation that is reshaping health systems, influencing health disparities, and shifting political norms, even as it introduces new ways of connecting and caring for those in the midst of health crises.

Theories of human behavior suggest that people\u2019s decisions to join a group and their subsequent behavior are influenced by perceptions of what is socially normative. In online discussions, where unruly, harassing behavior is common, displaying community rules could reduce concerns about harassment that prevent people from joining while also influencing the behavior of those who do participate. An experiment tested these theories by randomizing announcements of community rules to large-scale online conversations in a science-discussion community with 13 million subscribers.

This research study draws from interviews with Tumblr transition bloggers (n = 20), along with virtual ethnography, trans theory, and trans technological histories, using Tumblr as a case study to understand how social technologies can meet the needs of trans communities. Tumblr supported trans experiences by enabling users to change over time within a network of similar others, separate from their network of existing connections, and to embody (in a digital space) identities that would eventually become material. Further, before 2018 policy changes banning \u201cadult\u201d content, Tumblr upheld policies and an economic model that allowed erotic content needed for intersectional trans community building. We argue that these aspects made Tumblr a trans technology. We examine themes of temporality, openness, change, separation, realness, intersectionality, and erotics, along with considering social media platforms\u2019 policies and economic models, to show how trans technologies can provide meaningful spaces for trans communities.", "venue": "Feminist Media Studies", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 105, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2431050", "name": "Oliver L.

We present a framework for building content strategies that enable user participation in the development and delivery of content. Key concepts: For this framework to be successfully implemented, this implementation team needs a working knowledge of user-generated content strategy, or the development of strategies for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content that encourage user participation. The framework also requires an understanding of the relationship between content models and technologies. Finally, practitioners utilizing the framework must also understand the role of content moderation in facilitating development of user-generated content. Key lessons: Our framework for user-generated content strategy specifies three main practices: 1. Developing a content strategy that enables interactions among administrators, moderators, users, types of content, and technologies within a given network; 2. building content models within technologies so that all interactions flow seamlessly; and 3. using content moderation to ensure that users are empowered to contribute content while respecting quality guidelines. Implications: Though there are challenges to facilitating user-generated content that unites organizational goals and user goals, the use of a framework like ours can benefit organizations that want to make user-generated content a core part of what they do.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2275966", "name": "G.
