It centers on a very handsome young man called Narcissist. So attractive was this man that all the girls fell in love with him. He was aware of his charms and this made him arrogant and proud. Despite the efforts of the ladies to win his affections he ignored their overtures. One was especially attracted to him and did everything she could to win his attention. She too failed in her attempts. So desperate was she to win him that she prayed to a goddess that Narcissist would respond favorably. There was no answer. Finally with a broken heart she prayed that he would learn as she had what it was like to experience unrequited love. To this prayer there was an answer. One day as Narcissist was walking through the forest he stumbled upon a clear pool of water. As he knelt to drink for he was very thirsty the loveliest sight that had ever appeared captivated his attention. He immediately fell in love. So great was his attraction that he could not leave the pool and his appetite vanished. Before long his health deteriorated and he began to fade. In the end he died staring at this image in the pool striving the embrace the one object of his desire himself.", "venue": "Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic", "year": 1979, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1544, "influentialCitationCount": 39, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Psychology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "32394288", "name": "C.
