Abstract A \u201cjust punishment\u201d is increasingly structured by actuarial probability frameworks. Actuarial risk technologies are often characterized as having supplanted much of practitioners' discretionary decision making with structured, quantitatively derived decision-making templates. Some scholars maintain that the transition to risk-based penality has led to \u201cdeskilling,\u201d \u201cscientification,\u201d and \u201cerosion of professional discretion,\u201d or even to the elimination of criminal justice practitioners' use of professional discretion. This paper uses data from 71 semi-structured, open-ended interviews with criminal justice professionals to analyse how the introduction of risk tools shapes but does not eliminate discretion. We argue that risk tools are not simply imposed on criminal justice practitioners; instead, practitioners actively resist and embrace risk technologies and temper the impact risk tools have on their discretionary decision making. We maintain that the adoption of risk technologies reflects a negotiated process whereby practitioners welcome the professional advantages that these technologies afford while affirming the centrality of experience and clinical knowledge in decision making. We show how practitioners differentiate between the standardization intended by risk assessments and their own experiences and clinical knowledges, and how they exercise their discretion in an effort to mitigate the perceived discriminatory effects of the risk assessment. Thus, although risk tools are appealing to practitioners because their supposed \u201cobjectivity\u201d makes them more defensible to the public, the adoption and use of these tools in the context of professional decision making is more complex and contradictory than much of the theoretical literature has assumed.", "venue": "Canadian journal of law and society", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 69, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1413177183", "name": "Kelly Hannah-Moffat"}, {"authorId": "1470456256", "name": "Kelly Paula Sarah Maurutto"}, {"authorId": "1470450602", "name": "Kelly Paula Sarah Turnbull"}]}}, {"contexts": ["First, the concept of field pays closer attention to the structure of positions and positiontakings within a given space of expertise (Bourdieu, 1993; Eyal and Buchholz, 2010)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "06c91697891658791d0045df8b85a4ff6aad4211", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2133148777", "DOI": "10.1146/ANNUREV.SOC.012809.102625"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06c91697891658791d0045df8b85a4ff6aad4211", "title": "From the Sociology of Intellectuals to the Sociology of Interventions", "abstract": "This review suggests that the sociology of intellectuals is being converted into a sociology of interventions, i.e., instead of focusing on a certain social type, it analyzes the movement by which knowledge and expertise are mobilized to inform a value-laden intervention in the public sphere.

In addition, we show that by focusing on a particular social type it remained limited to only one mode of intervention into the public sphere.

His multi-disciplinary perspectives of science and technology, communication, and organization studies allow him to address the connections between technical, editorial, and work facets of new media. This approach yields analytical insights into the material culture of online newsrooms, the production processes of new media products, and the relationships between offline and online dynamics.Boczkowski traces daily newspapers' early consumer-oriented non-print publishing initiatives, from the now-forgotten videotex efforts of the 1980s to the rise of the World Wide Web in the mid- 1990s. He then examines the formative years of news on the Web during the second half of the 1990s, when the content of online newspapers varied from simple reproduction of the print edition to new material with interactive and multimedia features. With this picture of the recent history of non-print publishing as background, Boczkowski provides ethnographic, fly-on-the-wall accounts of three innovations in content creation: the Technology section of the New York Times on the Web, which was initially intended as the newspaper's space for experimentation with online news; the Virtual Voyager project of the HoustonChronicle.com, in which reporters pushed the envelope of multimedia journalism; and the Community Connection initiative of New Jersey Online, in which users became content producers. His analyses of these ventures reveal how innovation in online newspapers became an ongoing process in which different combinations of initial conditions and local contingencies led publishers along divergent paths of content creation.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 555, "influentialCitationCount": 41, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3077056", "name": "P.

But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm\u2019s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law \u2014 more particularly, through Title VII\u2019s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining\u2019s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others\u2019 discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying dataAddressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data\u2019s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cfairness.\u201d", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 15, "citationCount": 1350, "influentialCitationCount": 67, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2881033", "name": "Solon Barocas"}, {"authorId": "46432110", "name": "Andrew D.

Truckers, a spatially dispersed group of workers with a traditionally independent culture and a high degree of autonomy, are increasingly subjected to performance monitoring via fleet management systems that record and transmit fine-grained data about their location and behaviors. These systems redistribute operational information within firms by accruing real-time aggregated data in a remote company dispatcher. This redistribution results in a seemingly incongruous set of effects. First, abstracted and aggregated data streams allow dispatchers to quantitatively evaluate truckers\u2019 job performance across new metrics, and to challenge truckers\u2019 accounts of local and biophysical conditions. Second, even as these data are abstracted, information about truckers\u2019 activities is simultaneously resocialized via its strategic deployment into truckers\u2019 social relationships with their coworkers and families. These disparate dynamics operate together to facilitate firms\u2019 control over truckers\u2019 daily work practices in a manner that was not previously possible.

What did it take to write Big Data? A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for The Economist, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book Delete had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted Big Data to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read. Q. Are you big datas cheerleaders? A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big datas likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it. Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise? A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing peoples everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere. Q. Is Big Data then primarily a story about economic efficiency? A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but thats only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal changefrom urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life. Q. So big data offers only upside? A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book the dark side of big data. However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by propensity -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the fetishization of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations. Q. What can we do about this dark side? A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big datas risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues.

To do so, I suggest thinking of algorithms not \u201cin\u201d culture, as the event occasioning this essay was titled, but \u201cas\u201d culture: part of broad patterns of meaning and practice that can be engaged with empirically.

The article concludes with some thoughts regarding the role played by audience quantification and rationalization in shifting newswork practices.

They are particularly interested in knowledge and expertise in science, and how this relates to the public understanding and debate of scientific issues. This book represents a combination of considered reflection and experiment about the nature of expertise: what does it mean to be seen as, or to claim to be, an expert? The book\u2019s focus is in scientific domains, but the arguments and findings relate to expertise in any domain. Its main audience, however, does appear to be members of the sociology of scientific knowledge communities, which raises a question as to whether your reviewer has sufficient expertise in that domain to write this review \u2013 a point we shall return to later. In a relatively slim (153 pages) yet rigorous volume, Rethinking Expertise sets out to describe a programme of work that has been going on for many years and is still actively in progress: see for example the recent special issue of the journal Studies in History and Philosophy of Science (Collins, 2007). The book presents three main linked contributions: the \u2018Periodic Table of Expertises\u2019; some experiments in expertise; and the \u2018chain of meaning\u2019. The Periodic Table of Expertises is an attempt to categorise the various different types of expertise that might be thought to come into play when people make judgements. One of its objectives is to distinguish ubiquitous expertise (which every member of a society must have in order to live in it) from specialist expertise. One row categorises tacit knowledge in a domain, progressing from \u2018beer-mat knowledge\u2019 (required to do well in quizzes) through to \u2018contributory expertise\u2019 (the practical competence needed to carry out an activity). The most interesting and novel element of this row is the category previous to the latter one, \u2018interactional expertise\u2019. This is defined as the \u2018ability to master the language of a specialist domain in the absence of practical competence\u2019. Some journalists and sports commentators evidently possess this type of expertise, and Collins and Evans also ascribe it to (some?) sociologists and anthropologists. The other row in the table that captured your reviewer\u2019s attention is the fourth row, categorising what the authors term as meta-expertises. These are the capabilities used to judge how expert the (claimed) experts are. These range from \u2018ubiquitous discrimination\u2019, where the judge has no expertise in the domain at all, but judges the expert on the basis of their behaviour, consistency of reasoning and so on, to \u2018downward discrimination\u2019, where an expert is judging the competence of someone less expert in the same domain. Collins and Evans argue that this is as far as one can reliably go in judging expertise, which raises an interesting question about the peer review system used by KMRP and most other journals. The final category in this row is \u2018referred expertise\u2019, which involves using expertise learned in one domain in a different domain: this has particular Knowledge Management Research & Practice (2008) 6, 357\u2013359 & 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Despite default provisions based on the Fair Information Practices Principles (FIPPs), FERPA actually delegates most decision-making of student privacy to educational institutions and entities, without requiring meaningful transparency, oversight, or direct accountability due to numerous exceptions to the statute\u2019s consent requirement \u2014 particularly the \u201cSchool Official Exception\u201d that allows schools to share information with online providers.FIPPs-based privacy protection is both ineffective and theoretically unsound in the education context. Rather than refining a regulatory model not designed to provide the control and oversight sought in today\u2019s educational ecosystem, policymakers should focus on reforms that ensure baseline protection of student information, regulate problematic actors and practices directly, and create appropriate consequences for misuse and mismanagement.FERPA\u2019s efficacy rested on assumptions about information practices that no longer hold true given today\u2019s technological capabilities. The limited portability, permeability, and ability to repurpose paper records restricting disclosure to approved recipients prevented unauthorized actors from accessing student information and, in doing so, presumably limited inappropriate use or repurposing. Today, FERPA\u2019s reliance on educational actors\u2019 approval of data recipients does not account for unauthorized, accidental, and frequently unknowing disclosure of personally identifiable student information to outside parties.Legislators have scrambled to propose reforms to address student privacy concerns. These bills add procedural requirements, increased transparency, and more opportunities for parents and students to exercise consent. The amendments also impose substantive restrictions on certain information practices of educational actors and create direct accountability for educational actors through the creation of a private right of action and fines for non-compliance. Finally, they also regulate data recipients indirectly by creating additional qualifications and requiring contractual stipulations.Many of the proposed changes cannot provide the control over personal data and the reassurance sought by stakeholders because these bills still rely on FIPPs-based privacy protection without considering the distinct characteristics of the education context. Notions of notice and consent are particularly problematic where student participation is compulsory, or frequently coerced. Privacy self-management also poses practical, political, pedagogical, political, and philosophical difficulties distinctive to the education context. Further, federal regulation of non-educational actors indirectly through FERPA\u2019s framework is untenable. Additional reform is necessary to address the upset of information norms that made FERPA\u2019s delegation model framework acceptable for almost forty years. These include increasing transparency of information practices regarding student information, imposing procedural and governance requirements to provide more documentation of data flow, and requiring schools to have a comprehensive inventory of their information ecosystem, in a strong effort to regulate educational actors\u2019 collection, use, storage, and retention of student information.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "18103980", "name": "Elana Zeide"}]}}, {"contexts": ["From finance (Pasquale, 2015; Poon, 2009) to healthcare (Reich, 2012), education (Espeland and Sauder, 2016; Strathern, 2000; Zeide, 2016), journalism (Anderson, 2011a), human resources (O\u2019Neil, 2016), and criminal justice (Harcourt, 2006), algorithms and analytics are playing an increasingly\u2026", "From finance (Pasquale, 2015; Poon, 2009) to healthcare (Reich, 2012), education (Espeland and Sauder, 2016; Strathern, 2000; Zeide, 2016), journalism (Anderson, 2011a), human resources (O\u2019Neil, 2016), and criminal justice (Harcourt, 2006), algorithms and analytics are playing an increasingly important role in many expert occupations."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "6acdd4cab4ae540bfee0413712ccce9f92d6f24e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2777217236", "DOI": "10.1016/J.AOS.2009.02.003"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6acdd4cab4ae540bfee0413712ccce9f92d6f24e", "title": "From New Deal Institutions to Capital Markets: Commercial Consumer Risk Scores and the Making of Subprime Mortgage Finance", "abstract": "(Provides original sociological research on the development of consumer credit scoring in the United States and its links to subprime mortgage finance.)", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 156, "citationCount": 201, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "15098873", "name": "Martha A.

These different visions of the audience are correlated to different images of democracy, and they have different sociological implications. The public journalism movement believed in a form of democracy that was conversational and deliberative; in contrast, traditional journalism embraced an aggregative understanding of democracy, while Indymedia's democratic vision could best be seen as agonistic in nature. Demand Media and similar ventures, this article concludes, may be presaging an image of public that can best be described as algorithmic.

But although a large proportion of the top stories these sites disseminate cover politics, international relations, and economics, users of these sites show a preference (as evidenced by the most viewed stories) for news about sports, crime, entertainment, and weather. In this book, Pablo Boczkowski and Eugenia Mitchelstein examine this gap and consider the implications for the media industry and democratic life in the digital age. Drawing on analyses of more than 50,000 stories posted on twenty news sites in seven countries in North and South America and Western Europe, Boczkowski and Mitchelstein find that the gap in news preferences exists regardless of ideological orientation or national media culture. They show that it narrows in times of heightened political activity (including presidential elections or government crises) as readers feel compelled to inform themselves about public affairs but remains wide during times of normal political activity. Boczkowski and Mitchelstein also find that the gap is not affected by innovations in Web-native forms of storytelling such as blogs and user-generated content on mainstream news sites. Keeping the account of the news gap up to date, in the book's coda they extend the analysis through the 2012 U.S. presidential election.

Philip M. Napoli. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010. 272 pp. $27.50 pbk. Philip Napoli's new book, Audience Evolution: New Technologies and the Transformation of Media Audiences, is a good combination of a critical approach to audience measurement as well as a thorough review of the development of audience information systems. His key argument is that technologies foster the collection and compilation of audience information beyond the traditional exposure model, and allow new dimensions of audience information be incorporated into business use. Napoli, a professor in the Graduate School of Business at Fordham University and director of the Donald McGannon Communication Research Center, focuses on the institutionalized audience, in which the audience is understood and used as currencies in the formal procedures and practices of institutions such as media organizations and advertisers. \"The concept of audience is constructed and defined to reflect the economic and strategic imperatives of media organizations,\" he says. The book consists of six parts: (1) introduction, (2) contextualizing audience evolution, (3) the transformation of media consumption, (4) the transformation of audience information systems, (5) contesting audiences, and (6) the implications of audience revolution. Throughout, Napoli reminds readers that new and alternative dimensions of audience, such as engagement and appreciation of content, should be considered for a more complete picture of the audience's interaction with the content beyond the traditional exposure model. He also suggests that the new dimensions may increase acceptance of audience research results by content producers. The book builds on his previous Audience Economics: Media Institutions and the Audience Marketplace (2003). In this work, Napoli recognizes two key phenomena causing the change in media industries' conceptualization of audience related to technologies: audience fragmentation and audience autonomy. The proliferation of media platforms and outlets has resulted in diverting audience attention to more media channels. Various interactive technologies empower audiences to make choices and create user-generated content. The process of rationalization of audience understanding in the media industries highlighted in Audience Evolution is of high relevance to practitioners and researchers. By using \"scientific methods\" to collect audience information and then base business decisions upon them, media industries have moved from an intuitive model based on executive judgment to a more rational and objective model. There are, of course, negative consequences of such a model, such as stifling creativity and encouragement of homogenization. I like Napoli's discussion of the political economy of the audience measurement industry, in which various established media and stakeholders resist changes for their own interests and do not Support new measurement initiatives. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 231, "influentialCitationCount": 24, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144582009", "name": "Louisa Ha"}]}}, {"contexts": ["Depending on the organizational structure and relevant social groups involved in the trajectory of a given form, innovations may either achieve rhetorical closure or fail to be implemented (Barley, 1986; Pinch and Bijker, 1984)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "c4e70abcf9f61acc882db3502610aa1777e802fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2030461396", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511618925.007", "PubMed": "10281188"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4e70abcf9f61acc882db3502610aa1777e802fc", "title": "Technology as an occasion for structuring: evidence from observations of CT scanners and the social order of radiology departments.", "abstract": "New medical imaging devices, such as the CT scanner, have begun to challenge traditional role relations among radiologists and radiological technologists. Under some conditions, these technologies may actually alter the organizational and occupational structure of radiological work. However, current theories of technology and organizational form are insensitive to the potential number of structural variations implicit in role-based change. This paper expands recent sociological thought on the link between institution and action to outline a theory of how technology might occasion different organizational structures by altering institutionalized roles and patterns of interaction. In so doing, technology is treated as a social rather than a physical object, and structure is conceptualized as a process rather than an entity. The implications of the theory are illustrated by showing how identical CT scanners occasioned similar structuring processes in two radiology departments and yet led to divergent forms of organization. The data suggest that to understand how technologies alter organizational structures researchers may need to integrate the study of social action and the study of social form.", "venue": "Administrative science quarterly", "year": 1986, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 2849, "influentialCitationCount": 230, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2040894", "name": "S.

In what situations do people become aware of algorithms? How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people's use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this article examines people's personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary \u2013 ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function \u2013 is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself.
