Here, we analyze how news media organizations handle their relations to these increasingly important intermediaries. Based on a strategic case study, we argue that relationships between publishers and platforms are characterized by a tension between (1) short-term, operational opportunities and (2) long-term strategic worries about becoming too dependent on intermediaries. We argue that these relationships are shaped by news media\u2019s fear of missing out, the difficulties of evaluating the risk/reward ratios, and a sense of asymmetry. The implication is that news media that developed into an increasingly independent institution in the 20th century\u2014in part enabled by news media organizations\u2019 control over channels of communication\u2014are becoming dependent upon new digital intermediaries that structure the media environment in ways that not only individual citizens but also large, resource-rich, powerful organizations have to adapt to.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 176, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2212978", "name": "R.
