In Study I, 750 people were surveyed as they walked through a public plaza that was being captured by a HDTV camera and displayed in real-time in the office of a building overlooking the plaza. In Study II, 120 individuals were interviewed about the same topic. Moreover, Study II controlled for whether the participant was a direct stakeholder of the technology (inside the office watching people on the HDTV large-plasma display window) or an indirect stakeholder (being watched in the public venue). Taking both studies together, results showed the following: (a) the majority of participants upheld some modicum of privacy in public; (b) people\u2019s privacy judgments were not a one-dimensional construct, but often involved considerations based on physical harm, psychological wellbeing, and informed consent; and (c) more women than men expressed concerns about the installation, and, unlike the men, equally brought forward their concerns whether they were The Watcher or The Watched. 234 FRIEDMAN ET AL.", "venue": "Media Space 20+ Years of Mediated Life", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 119, "citationCount": 85, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144029598", "name": "Batya Friedman"}, {"authorId": "144674612", "name": "P.
