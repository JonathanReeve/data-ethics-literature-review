Hours into launch, however, the chatbot\u2019s mimetic programming structure was taken advantage of by organized groups of online social media users, and Tay.ai began replying to queries with alt-right and neo-Nazi ideology. In this article, I explore the role that Tay.ai\u2019s assigned gender and race played in influencing both Tay.ai\u2019s initial design and, subsequently, the program\u2019s monstrous evolution. This is achieved through three avenues of thought. First, I situate Tay within the new public of Web 2.0, a space reliant on user participation and beholden to the neoliberal, racialized, and gendered architectures that produce it. I then consider Tay as an evolution of the chatbot, arguing that Tay is emblematic of both race and gender as social technologies.

Ultimately, the article argues that \u201calt-lite\u201d figures are united by a set of mitigating rhetorical strategies, which are used to temper and obfuscate their reactionary views. These strategies include performatively aligning with one minority group to denigrate another; highlighting personal relationships with non-white people and knowledge of non-white cultures; embracing a color-blind worldview purportedly rooted in the civil rights movement; and maintaining ironic distance when espousing more overtly hateful racial stereotypes.

Moreover, retweets can help spread a message well beyond the reach of its original poster. Thus, users\u2019 interactions with posts containing or making reference to racism or sexism both illuminate the ways individuals accept, challenge, or engage with racism and sexism online, and shape how those messages spread. Using an original dataset of 59.5 million tweets, I test how particular features of messages referencing Black and Asian women predict user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies). This analysis further focuses on messages including terms that express racist or sexist content. Generally, messages including covert racist or sexist insults have a modest positive effect on all measures of user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies), which may suggest that social media environments allow individuals the time and opportunity to contend with topics that can be more difficult in-person. Additionally, variations in engagement with tweets that include references to women, Black or Asian individuals implies that users respond differently to messages involving references to and normative images of different racial, ethnic, and gendered identities.

Google Trends, news media and tweets were used to analyze Zoombombing as a form of cyberhate, particularly digital racism.FindingsThe results reveal prevalent Zoom-mediated racism toward Asian Americans, African Americans and Jewish Americans. This study understands Zoombombing from a sociopolitical/cultural perspective through news reporting of victimized cases and explores various ways that Zoombombing shapes, mediates, transforms and escalates racism.Originality/valueThis study is one of the very first studies to analyze Zoombombing in a way that builds upon an emerging body of literature on cyberhate. This paper considers Zoom as a space where curious young people, cybercriminals, extremists and hackers impose their ideologies and beliefs upon newly established online learning and working environments and engage in a struggle for identity recognition in the midst of increasingly accessible vulnerable software and cyberspace.", "venue": "Online Information Review", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 55, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "88289538", "name": "C.

In medical crowdfunding (MCF), online platforms allow individuals to appeal to social networks to request donations for health and medical needs. Users are often told that success depends on how they organize and share their campaigns to increase social network engagement. However, experts have cautioned that MCF could exacerbate health and social disparities by amplifying the choices (and biases) of the crowd and leveraging these to determine who has access to financial support for healthcare. To date, research on potential axes of disparity in MCF, and their impacts on fundraising outcomes, has been limited. To answer these questions, this paper presents an exploratory cross-sectional study of a randomized sample of 637 MCF campaigns on the popular platform GoFundMe, for which the race, gender, age, and relationships of campaigners and campaign recipients were categorized alongside campaign characteristics and outcomes. Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the analysis examines race, gender, and age disparities in MCF use, and tests how these are associated with differential campaign outcomes. The results show systemic disparities in MCF use and outcomes: people of color (and black women in particular) are under-represented; there is significant evidence of an additional digital care labor burden on women organizers of campaigns; and marginalized race and gender groups are associated with poorer fundraising outcomes. Outcomes are only minimally associated with campaign characteristics under users\u2019 control, such as photos, videos, and updates. These results corroborate widespread concerns with how technology fuels health inequities, and how crowdfunding may be creating an unequal and biased marketplace for those seeking financial support to access healthcare. Further research and better data access are needed to explore these dynamics more deeply and inform policy for this largely unregulated industry.", "venue": "PloS one", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 127, "citationCount": 17, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science", "Computer Science", "Business", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5275704", "name": "Nora Kenworthy"}, {"authorId": "152476115", "name": "Zhihang Dong"}, {"authorId": "32180344", "name": "A.

This is a formerly offline space made newly visible by digital networked media. It includes discursive spaces and forms such as White supremacist websites, anti-climate science forums, militant \u2018men\u2019s rights\u2019 sites, anti-immigration Facebook pages, gay hate memes, misogynist trolling, anti-Semitic websites, alt-right websites and \u2018truth\u2019 (conspiracy) websites, to name a few, where discussion flouts norms of public debate, rules of argument and requirements for the rational consideration of evidence for its own ends. Building on earlier work on anti-publics by McKenzie Wark and Bart Cammaerts, and working from examples from several different domains of online anti-public discourse, I argue that despite its size and complexity, it is possible and necessary to theorise this heterogeneous discursive field, not least because while such discourse is often dismissed, the meanings developed in such domains increasingly intermingle with and inform everyday democratic discourse. While we tend to think of extreme and irrational online discourse as aberrant and alien to everyday democratic discourse, analysis suggests that such discourse in fact is a precise reflection of an everyday \u2018post-normative\u2019 democratic discourse that has itself become deeply inflected with reactionary and populist themes.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 105, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145564205", "name": "Mark Davis"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "323ab57da48cd99fd884a5c24a0ecf4d5650ebbc", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1017/9781108348195.034"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/323ab57da48cd99fd884a5c24a0ecf4d5650ebbc", "title": "Index", "abstract": null, "venue": "The Cambridge Handbook of Discourse Studies", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 1757, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": []}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "32ac5e3602f820f4a918d1eb18497d75f446788a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3090242251", "DOI": "10.1017/9781108348195.005"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32ac5e3602f820f4a918d1eb18497d75f446788a", "title": "Historicity, Interdiscursivity and Intertextuality in Discourse Studies", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 1928, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "103894530", "name": "Branca Falabella Fabr\u00edcio"}, {"authorId": "1412552315", "name": "L.

By integrating the philosophical approaches to the body of Butler and several phenomenologists, the author suggests alternative ways of understanding online learning environments based on a literature review.

Findings suggest that Black immigrant households primarily access the Internet through smartphone and laptop devices along with mobile and at-home hi-speed Internet plans.

We then offer three interpretations of the Whiteness of AI, drawing on critical race theory, particularly the idea of the White racial frame. First, we examine the extent to which this Whiteness might simply reflect the predominantly White milieus from which these artefacts arise. Second, we argue that to imagine machines that are intelligent, professional, or powerful is to imagine White machines because the White racial frame ascribes these attributes predominantly to White people. Third, we argue that AI racialised as White allows for a full erasure of people of colour from the White utopian imaginary.

In exploring transnationalization, fifty purposively selected memes are culled from the Facebook group Robert Mugabe Quotes and subjected to critical linguistic analysis. In the evaluation of the data which is achieved through the linguistic examination of cross-cultural themes in the formulation of identity, didactics, and ideology, sixteen memes, representative of the overarching tripartite concerns, are used as exemplifications. Reliant on the bipartite postulations of Critical Linguistic Stylistics\u2014a linguistic theory that examines the style and peculiarities of linguistic data\u2014and Relief Theory of Humour\u2014which considers humour as a platform for the assuagement of tension and emotions, the memes are testamental of prevailing concerns\u2014 politics, technology, social/international relations, sex, male\u2013female relations, etc.\u2014in the human society at large. Linguistic markers such as oppositional expressions, capitalization, and other graphological features are annexed in meaning-formation.

In this chapter, we review research on the framing power of metaphor and metonymy, with a particular focus on studies that are relevant to or directly concerned with the use of metaphor in discourse, broadly conceived. We begin with an overview of rhetorical approaches to metaphor as a tool for persuasion and of cognitive approaches to metaphor as a tool for thinking, including both theoretical and empirical studies. We review a variety of studies that have investigated the framing function of metaphor, and, to a lesser extent, metonymy, in authentic language use from a range of sources (e.g. politics, science and education) and using different qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Focusing on metaphor, where the evidence is most robust, we critically examine the relationship between, broadly speaking, cognitive and discourse-based approaches to metaphor. We go on to provide a concrete example of the framing function of metaphor in healthcare discourse, and show how cognitive and discourse perspectives can be usefully combined into a multilevel analytical framework that can, among other things, be used to make recommendations for professional practice and training.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 1928, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5455469", "name": "Z.

Public discussion around harassment - with a particular focus on sexual violence against women - reached its ferment in the light of charges brought against a number of high-profile public figures and with the #MeToo movement. Within the academy, radical, feminist, and anti-racist scholars have recently faced targeted harassment and threats of violence through email campaigns organized online by right-wing and white supremacist online. Many have pointed to the specificity of the digital medium as facilitating new forms of harassment online. Yet, others have shown how digital spaces might be better seen in continuity with older forms of violence, that have long targeted communities of color working to challenge racist systems of oppression. We contribute to this line of thinking by examining a case of white supremacist violence against a Black family - the Wades - who purchased a home in a predominantly white neighbourhood in Louisville, Kentucky in the 1950s. With attention to both Black and digital geographies, we juxtapose the Wade\u2019s story with critical work on newer forms of white supremacy online. We show how hatred persists alongside shifts in medium, and question the extent to which digital platforms create new opportunities for harassment and violence.", "venue": "Gender, Place & Culture", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 98, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46503381", "name": "Carrie Mott"}, {"authorId": "51043942", "name": "Daniel G.

Often focused on the policy implications \u2013 at both institutional and grass-roots level \u2013 of public signage, linguistic landscape research has, from the very beginning, engaged with issues of politics and ideology and thus, indirectly, discourse. In recent years it has also begun to theorise the ways in which semiotic artefacts and practices generate meaning by interacting in explicitly dialogical ways. To date however, theorising that is directed specifically at the relationship between linguistic landscape studies and discourse studies has been slight. This chapter explores the nature of this relationship by focusing on select case studies which exemplify the way that acts of linguistic and semiotic display in the public arena operate as key sites for social organisation and for political regulation and contestation. These short case studies also examine how meaning is generated through complex layering of contexts, the interplay between multiple signs, the narrative potential of landscapes and the dialogic possibilities presented by social media which allow local meanings to be up-scaled and reconfigured, thus pulling site-specific semiotic events into much broader discourses.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 1989, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "69414976", "name": "P.

The political culture of the United States is more conservative and religious than the political culture in Europe. While the electoral system and the two-party system largely prevented the success of extreme parties, movements such as the right-wing populist but multi-faceted Tea Party had significant political influence. As a result of globalization, immigration, and technological progress, parts of the American economy went through difficult times, made many people feel abandoned, and frightened about their prospects. Such socio-economic developments and fears as well as cultural change contributed to the electoral success of President Donald Trump.", "venue": "The Radical Right", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 72, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2073023611", "name": "K.

It adopts Bourdieu\u2019s concept of habitus to examine the online practice of fans for evidence of racist discourse and the extent to which this was supported or contested by fellow fans. The overall findings are that online debates about race in Australian Rules Football and wider Australian society remain divided, with some posters continuing to reflect racial prejudice and discrimination towards non-whites. However, for the vast majority, views deemed to have racist connotations are contested and challenged in a presentation centering on social change and racial equality", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47050997", "name": "Jamie Cleland"}, {"authorId": "40105972", "name": "K.

An analysis of African Americans' responses to marginalized Black male characters politicizes the racial milieu of the series against the backdrop of wider racial relationships in the United States. Moreover,\u00a0The Walking Dead\u00a0is a successful transmedia franchise, and thus racial discourse shifts and changes, depending on which transmedia texts are being consumed. Thus, Black antifan rhetoric aimed at the spin-off series\u00a0Fear the Walking Dead\u00a0(2015\u2013) centers on the zombification of Black men, a metaphor of the mistreatment and othering of young Black men by US police. Comparatively,\u00a0The Walking Dead\u00a0video game (TellTale Games, 2012) offers character development for its Black male lead character that fans praise against wider cultural representations in relation to both the franchise's hyperdiegesis and to video games in general. Therefore, Black audiences may read\u00a0The Walking Dead\u00a0as both racially reductive and radical. In doing so, aspects of self-identity, such as race, can inform (anti)fan positions through intersectional politics.", "venue": "Transformative Works and Cultures", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 83, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Art"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144828218", "name": "J.
