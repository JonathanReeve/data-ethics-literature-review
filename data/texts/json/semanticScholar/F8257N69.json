Such reliance includes the exploration of public views on important social issues such as gender-based violence (GBV). In this study, we examine big (social) data consisting of nearly fourteen million tweets collected from Twitter over a period of ten months to analyze public opinion regarding GBV, highlighting the nature of tweeting practices by geographical location and gender. We demonstrate the utility of Computational Social Science to mine insight from the corpus while accounting for the influence of both transient events and sociocultural factors. We reveal public awareness regarding GBV tolerance and suggest opportunities for intervention and the measurement of intervention effectiveness assisting both governmental and non-governmental organizations in policy development.", "venue": "PeerJ Prepr.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 22, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science", "Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "7147418", "name": "Hemant Purohit"}, {"authorId": "1811614", "name": "Tanvi Banerjee"}, {"authorId": "31941584", "name": "Andrew J.
