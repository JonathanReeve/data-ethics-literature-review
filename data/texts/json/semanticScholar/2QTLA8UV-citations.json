More specifically, this study explores virtual points' and leaderboards' effects on CS identity development, self-efficacy, and performance. The results show that virtual points and the leaderboard contributed to improved performance for students of all genders, suggesting that gamification is a gender-neutral learning engagement strategy that improves female students' performance as much as male students. Regardless of improved performance, most women did not actively enjoy or were motivated by the virtual points or leaderboard in SEP-CyLE.

In the UK, women make up less than 20% of CS students at A-Level and undergraduate level. The lack of diversity within CS has become well-studied, often through quantitative surveys of female CS students or evaluations of different pedagogical or cultural interventions aimed to increase diversity and inclusivity. However, there have been far fewer studies that explore the experiences of female CS students at a more in-depth, qualitative level. This paper reports on the results of 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews with first year female CS undergraduate students at a UK university. Several of our findings are consistent with much existing research, such as the prevalence of gendered CS stereotypes and a lack of confidence. However, we also find two key strategies by which female Computer Science students navigate their minority experience that have not been given much prior attention. Firstly, we find that female CS students find it hard to articulate their minority experience without utilising the linguistic device of hedging. Asked about their experiences as a minority, participants would often mention a negative feeling in relation to this situation, followed quickly by a diminishing clause- 'it's a bit weird, but it's ok'. Secondly, participants tended to individualise the problem, stressing the importance of their own individual responsibility to fit into CS and succeed, despite having sometimes experienced discrimination or sexism.

We used ASA to organize and make sense of the data by first creating a table listing the points on the activity system triangle (subject, rules, object, etc.) and filling in the points of the triangle based on the design of the coaching and learning group as described by participants; this gave us a high-level view of the activity system.

A self-efficacy questionnaire on computer programming was applied to courses A (n=33) and B (n =46) to compare the experience of women in the modality of individual and group work. The results indicate that women in course B tend to assume roles of coordination and work management, unlike men who define themselves as programmers or designers.

At the start of each year, we meet enthusiastic and successful students who are passionate about law. They arrive on campus invested in learning, ready to work hard, and eager to participate in class. But trouble brews soon thereafter. Students worry whether they have what it takes to do well, whether they will fit in, and whether they belong in law school. Answering questions in class, many sense (rightly or wrongly) that their professors and peers think that they aren\u2019t smart and that they will not do well. When they encounter difficulty making friends, finding study groups, and connecting with professors in office hours, they worry that \u201cmaybe this means that people like me do not belong or cannot succeed here.\u201d Worse yet, discussions in class lead many to lose sight of why they chose to go to law school and the important role that lawyers play in serving the public.

Method: Using an experimental design, undergraduate students viewed a syllabus that included or excluded ISCs from either a White male or female professor.

First, we discuss the theoretical foundations of our bias cycle theory and describe why understanding the nature of workplace bias\u2014and effectively reducing it\u2014requires considering the reciprocal influences of both individual and organizational levels of the cycle. Specifically, we describe how workplace bias operates as a cycle and then propose that successfully reducing workplace bias requires multilevel interventions that interrupt bias across both the individual and organizational levels of the cycle. Second, because workplace bias is reproduced through both of these levels, we review and bring together literatures that are often considered separately: psychology research on reducing bias at the individual level and sociology and management research on reducing bias at the organizational level. Third, we use our bias cycle theory to formulate general principles for determining how to begin and how to pair interventions across levels.

There are many factors that may influence students\u2019 pursuit of computing beyond introductory courses, including their sense that they can do what CS courses require of them (their self-efficacy) and positive emotional experiences in CS courses. When interest has been addressed in computing education, research has treated it mostly as an outcome of particular pedagogical approaches or curricula; what has not been studied is how students\u2019 longer-term interest develops through more granular experiences that students have as they begin to engage with computing. In this paper, we present the results of a study designed to investigate how students\u2019 interest in computing develops as a product of their momentary self-efficacy and affective experiences. Using a methodology that is relatively uncommon to computer science education\u2014the experience sampling method, which involves frequently asking students brief, unobtrusive questions about their experiences\u2014we surveyed CS1 students every week over the course of a semester to capture the nuances of their experiences. 74 CS1 students responded 14-18 times over the course of a semester about their self-efficacy, frustration, and situational interest. With this data, we used a multivariate, multi-level statistical model that allowed us to estimate how students\u2019 granular, momentary experiences (measured through the experience sampling method surveys) and initial interest, self-efficacy, and self-reported gender (measured through traditional surveys) relate to their longer-term interest and achievement in the course. We found that students\u2019 momentary experiences have a significant impact on their interest in computing and course outcomes, even controlling for the self-efficacy and interest students reported at the beginning of the semester. We also found significant gender differences in students\u2019 momentary experiences, however, these were reduced substantially when students\u2019 self-efficacy was added to the model, suggesting that gender gaps could instead be self-efficacy gaps. These results suggest that students\u2019 momentary experiences in CS1, how they experience the course week to week, have an impact on their longer-term interest and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we found that male and female students reported different experiences, suggesting that improving the CS1 experiences that students have could help to close gender-related participation gaps. In all, this study shows that the granular experiences students have in CS1 matter for key outcomes of interest to computing education researchers and educators and that the experience sampling method, more common in fields adjacent to computer science education, provides one way for researchers to integrate the experiences students have into our accounts of why students become interested in computing.", "venue": "ICER", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 142, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2663596", "name": "Alex Lishinski"}, {"authorId": "2057298537", "name": "Joshua Rosenberg"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "371470a6e86c82132c15570bb60ea2200908e128", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3175278240", "DOI": "10.1007/s11218-021-09639-6"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/371470a6e86c82132c15570bb60ea2200908e128", "title": "Nevertheless, she persisted (in science research): Enhancing women students\u2019 science research motivation and belonging through communal goals", "abstract": "There is no doubt that connections with other people motivate behavior; yet science is stereotyped as being lonely work devoid of communal connections.

In a scientific context designed to simulate a \u201ctypical\u201d setting that emphasized gender and the male-dominated nature of STEM, women and men students interacted with a male confederate [Study 1 (N\u2009=\u2009245)] or women students interacted with a female confederate [Study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009152)].

This is particularly true for minoritized students in introductory CS courses. The methods used so far to study sense of belonging in CS have been qualitative or have used a small number of survey items. In this paper, we validate a large 30-item survey originally developed for Mathematics. We collected data from 21 institutions, with 30 faculty and 1165 survey responses. We present a factor analysis for the survey to highlight how it measures factors like 'Membership', 'Acceptance', 'Affect', 'Trust' and 'Desire to Fade'. We measured the students' sense of belonging using the survey and found that it correlates with their learning and their interest to pursue more CS courses. These correlations were nuanced based on students' gender, race, and the type of learning environment. We found that for minoritized students in particular, the interest to pursue CS courses was more correlated with their sense of belonging. A type of learning environment we examined was Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). We studied the differences in sense of belonging between POGIL and non-POGIL classrooms. Although we did not find a significant difference in overall sense of belonging at the factor level, we did find significant differences when we examined at the item level.

Both social-belonging components are important for students' performance and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In addition to differential social belonging across demographics at the beginning of the course, social belonging can change in response to course performance. This change in social belonging may further affect performance which may further affect social belonging in a recursive spiral.

Review of the literature shows varied aspects of both stereotyped identities and cognition are inconsistently explored across studies. Only a portion of the literature focuses on ST's impact on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). It is important to understand and learn to mitigate ST, particularly for historically marginalized and systemically oppressed BIPOC patients. Relevance exists for neuropsychologists, who engage in activities (i.e., assessments) that may activate ST, and should be aware of additional factors impacting testing results and clinical decision making.\n\n\nMETHOD\nUsing scoping review criteria (Peters et\u00a0al., 2015) and Preferred Reporting Item for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we reviewed literature across multiple databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, PsychINFO) on ST and cognition with a focus on BIPOC.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe current literature suggests that race-based ST may be implicated in underperformance for executive functioning and separately working memory.

Do different understanding of equality stall progress? In the target article, Lewis (this issue) explores these questions. He challenges the assumption that everyone must agree on racial equality, for it is immensely difficult to reach consensus due to structural dynamics (e.g., racial segregation, White-oriented media) that shape people\u2019s perceptions. One solution, Lewis argues, is to set aside hopes of reaching consensus before taking action. Instead, we can move toward an expert-driven approach, calling on a diverse group of experts\u2014specifically, experts \u201con the experiences of those who have been disempowered and marginalized\u201d (Lewis, this issue, p. 159)\u2014to work with policymakers to implement evidence-based interventions. I agree with Lewis\u2019s conclusion: Waiting for everyone to reach consensus on the causes of, reasons for, and solutions to racial inequality is an exercise in futility. However, an expert-driven approach comes with its own set of challenges. Experts\u2014even well-intentioned ones\u2014 are people, too. They are not immune to attitudes (e.g., bias) and cognitions (e.g., stereotypes) that maintain inequality. As psychologists, we must consider how these factors complicate an expert-driven approach toward racial equality. I draw on evidence from race, gender, and inequality scholarship to explore how attitudes and cognitions can stymie an expertbased approach, resulting in teams of experts that are not truly diverse, that do not value all of its members, and are not heard or heeded by policymakers. An expert-driven approach toward racial equality requires (a) diverse teams of experts, (b) inclusive and efficient teams of experts, and (c) persuasive teams of experts. Successfully implementing these steps could yield immense payoffs, helping the United States and the world solve a problem that has plagued it for centuries. However, assembling a diverse team of experts that is inclusive, effective, and persuasive is fraught with challenges that we cannot afford to ignore.

To understand factors that lead to attrition of women from academic research, we analyzed a database of mentoring relationships covering the period 2000 to 2015 in several science and humanities fields. While representation of women has increased over time among both trainees and independent researchers, male graduate students and postdocs still continue to independent research at higher rates than their women colleagues. We analyzed aspects of the mentoring relationship that contribute to this continuing bias. One strong pattern that is observed is homophily, where trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender. It has been hypothesized that institutional bias may limit the influence of female investigators, which could in turn impact the retention of their trainees in academia. Indeed, we observe trainees of female mentors are less likely to continue into independent research careers than trainees of male mentors. This disparity persists, but is reduced, after controlling for temporal trends in retention rates and under-representation of women mentors at the highest levels of funding and citation. Although the trainee pool for mentors that receive highly prestigious awards is skewed towards men, homophily is otherwise unrelated to mentor achievement.

This study aimed at examining the gender and race difference in elementary students\u2019 attitudes towards CS. To that end we developed and validated a survey instrument called Elementary Computer Science Attitudes (E-CSA) which consisted of the constructs of CS self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, through a combination of classical test theory and item response theory. The target audience for this instrument and study was upper elementary students (grades 4 and 5, ages 8 to 11). The E-CSA was found to be a gender and race bias-free instrument. A two-way ANOVA test was then used to answer research questions. We found no significant interaction effect between gender and race in the two constructs of CS Attitudes. We also did not see a significant difference based on race. However, a significant difference was found in both CS attitudes constructs based on gender, whereby male students had higher CS attitudes than female students. We discuss our findings from the perspective of the equity issue in CS education.

However, these fields differ vastly in female representation: women tend to be most strongly underrepresented in technological and computer science university majors and to a lesser extent in mathematics and chemistry, while they are less underrepresented in biological sciences. To understand this variability, we examine how girls in the process of making higher education choices compare different STEM-fields to each other. We draw upon dimensional comparison theory, which argues that educational motivation involves intra-individual comparisons of achievement across school subjects. However, previous research has shown that a focus on achievement in STEM is not enough, anticipated belonging in a STEM-field plays a pivotal role in interest in pursuing that field. Consistent with this, we examined participants\u2019 comparisons of anticipated belonging across STEM-fields. A sample of 343 high school girls in STEM-focused university tracks completed a survey on their anticipated belonging and interest in pursuing different STEM majors. Latent Profile Analysis resulted in 3 profiles, showing different belonging comparison patterns across STEM-fields. Examining these comparisons\u2014both within and across profiles\u2014showed how girls felt pushed away from certain STEM-fields and pulled toward others. The findings suggest that for interest in pursuing specific STEM-fields it is not just about the level of anticipated belonging within that STEM-field, but just as much about the level of anticipated belonging in comparison to another STEM-field.

Method: This paper reports on a longitudinal, qualitative study investigating female boot camp attendees.
