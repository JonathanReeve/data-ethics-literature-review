This framing reveals categories of a discourse of time that include articulations of efficiency, speed, time as a technical resource, and notions of the future manifest in each project. The discursive categories fit into a time constructs model that exposes how these projects were built with regard to concepts of speed and how different notions of time are expressed as a design ideology intertwined with other ideologies.

CAPTCHA, and its many derivatives, are presented as content identification mechanisms: the user is asked to identify content in order for the computer to determine the identity of the user. This twofold process of content identification, however, has evolved significantly since CAPTCHA\u2019s inception in the late 1990s. Pivoting away from a realist framework, largely dependent on the standard tenets [of] cryptography, toward a relational framework premised on aesthetic contingency and social consensus, CAPTCHA\u2019s arc uniquely illustrates how contested notions of both \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201cidentity\u201d become materialized in contemporary internet infrastructure. Inspired by Walter Benjamin\u2019s exegetical study of early photography, this critical historicization aims to foreground CAPTCHA as a particularly fraught juncture of humans and computers, which, as with Benjamin\u2019s intervention, productively troubles received ideas of humanism and automation, mediation and materiality.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 91, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1395700550", "name": "B.

User barriers like devices and connectivity have declined as mobile phone prices have become more affordable and infrastructure has continued to develop, connecting more communities globally. App development has also evolved to better suit users on low-cost Android devices. Lite apps have entered the space as a solution for users in constrained environments. While there are many benefits to lite app designs, their effectiveness is unclear for their likely target beneficiaries: NIUs coming online. In this mixed-method study we explore the experience for NIUs trying out a smartphone with lite apps for a month in Brazil and India (n=62). We conducted this research by collecting diary data and follow-up in-person interviews. Results found that three phases of challenges occurred in the first 28 days with a lite smartphone: 1) getting started with accounts, 2) learning how to use the mobile platform and apps, and 3) meeting expectations and mastering the internet.

Through ethnographic fieldwork of a diasporic Vietnamese entrepreneurial organization, this article explains why this attempt to create economic potential through Vietnamese ethnicity eventually failed. The ethnic platform was organized around two regimes of futurity. On the one hand, the ethnic platform was founded on a hope for a transcendent Vietnamese ethnicity that organized future as potential and forward momentum. This future potential, however, stood at odds with the future present of a refugee subjectivity that shaped the ethnic formation of many of these diasporic entrepreneurs. Hence, the ethnic platform was situated at the disjuncture between incommensurate ethnic temporalities.

We find that, like in North America and Europe, the prevalent mental threat model indicates a lack of understanding of how Internet technologies operate.
