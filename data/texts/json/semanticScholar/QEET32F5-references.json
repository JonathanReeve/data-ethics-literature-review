Data from a survey of news organizations and an analysis of features on their websites suggest levels of innovation are low, and institutionalist tendencies dominate decision-making about product change. Where innovation occurs, it is due to corporate coercion and resources, and concrete evidence from the organization's market. Uncertainty about audiences and technologies tends to reinforce institutionalist tendencies by encouraging managers to follow present industry trends.

Legitimate bots generate a large amount of benign tweets delivering news and updating feeds, while malicious bots spread spam or malicious contents. More interestingly, in the middle between human and bot, there has emerged cyborg referred to either bot-assisted human or human-assisted bot. To assist human users in identifying who they are interacting with, this paper focuses on the classification of human, bot and cyborg accounts on Twitter. We first conduct a set of large-scale measurements with a collection of over 500,000 accounts. We observe the difference among human, bot and cyborg in terms of tweeting behavior, tweet content, and account properties. Based on the measurement results, we propose a classification system that includes the following four parts: (1) an entropy-based component, (2) a machine-learning-based component, (3) an account properties component, and (4) a decision maker.

As the cost of reaching consumers drops dramatically, our markets are shifting from a one-size-fits-all model of mass appeal to one of unlimited variety for unique tastes. From supermarket shelves to advertising agencies, the ability to offer vast choice is changing everything, and causing us to rethink where our markets lie and how to get to them. Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it, from DVDs at Netflix to songs on iTunes to advertising on Google. However, this is not just a virtue of online marketplaces; it is an example of an entirely new economic model for business, one that is just beginning to show its power. After a century of obsessing over the few products at the head of the demand curve, the new economics of distribution allow us to turn our focus to the many more products in the tail, which collectively can create a new market as big as the one we already know. The Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance.

What did it take to write Big Data? A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for The Economist, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book Delete had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted Big Data to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read. Q. Are you big datas cheerleaders? A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big datas likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it. Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise? A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing peoples everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere. Q. Is Big Data then primarily a story about economic efficiency? A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but thats only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal changefrom urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life. Q. So big data offers only upside? A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book the dark side of big data. However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by propensity -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the fetishization of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations. Q. What can we do about this dark side? A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big datas risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues.

European films were being exhibited in large numbers from nearly every major film producing country in Europe. The Europeans, or at least the German and Soviet cinemas, were enjoying unparalleled artistic prestige in the United States. Of courseEuropean filmshad been imported to America in large numbers prior to World War I and there have been many periods when European films have been influential. What made this period unique was that these imports in the late 1920s gave birth to the foundation of American independent film culture, the little theatre movement. From almost the beginning of its existence, various groups had opposed the commercial American film industry on moral or social grounds; however, the little theatre movement was the first organized opposition to Hollywood on the basis of aesthetic principles. The supporters of the little theatre movement rejected Hollywood\u2019s formula of a disposable, mass produced and impersonal cinema of entertainment designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience in favor of a personal cinema that sought to explore the boundaries of film art. The little theatre movement strove to elevate the cinema to a position of equality among the fine arts. Inspired by the little theatres of the stage, the little theatre movement sought to establish an alternative exhibition system that was not solely based on commercial considerations. These smaller theatres would present films that could not draw a large enough audience to attract the interest of the major commercial exhibitors and distributors but which still contained elements of artistic, political or historical significance. The theatres catered to an educated, often wealthy audience comprised of the cultural and intellectual elite as well as the radical left that was alienated by Hollywood. This audience was less passive than the commercial audience. Many little theatres required their audience to become members of the theatre and encouraged discussion of the films they screened. The problem for the little theatre exhibitors was finding artistic films to exhibit. If one rejected the films coming out of the major Hollywood studios, there were not a lot of alternatives in the United States. Almost all the American independent film producers worked within the same parameters as the big studios only on a smaller budget. The crude genre films they churned out were even less artistic than the mainstream studio films. The handful of pioneers making artistic or experimental films in America in the late 1920s were insufficient to program even a single theatre. The little theatres were forced to look abroad to Europe for their films. Film History, Volume 17, pp. 261\u2013284, 2005. Copyright \u00a9 John Libbey Publishing ISSN: 0892-2160.

This Article considers that question in the context of an area of increasing importance \u2013 algorithm-based decisions. I begin by looking to broadly accepted legal sources, which for the First Amendment means primarily Supreme Court jurisprudence. That jurisprudence provides for very broad First Amendment coverage, and the Court has reinforced that breadth in recent cases. Under the Court\u2019s jurisprudence the First Amendment (and the heightened scrutiny it entails) would apply to many algorithm-based decisions, specifically those entailing substantive communications. We could of course adopt a limiting conception of the First Amendment, but any nonarbitrary exclusion of algorithm-based decisions would require major changes in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence.

Addressing the larger question of what the Web is for, Rogers argues that the Web is still the best arena for unsettling the official and challenging the familiar.Rogers describes the politics at work on the Web as either back-end -- the politics of search engine technology -- or front-end -- the diversity, inclusivity, and relative prominence of sites publicly accessible on the Web. To analyze this, he developed four \"political instruments,\" or software tools that gather information about the Web by capturing dynamic linking practices, attention cycles for issues, and changing political party commitments. On the basis of his findings on how information politics works, Rogers argues that the Web should be, and can be, a \"collision space\" for official and unofficial accounts of reality. (One chapter, \"The Viagra Files\" offers an entertaining analysis of official and unofficial claims for the health benefits of Viagra.) The distinctiveness of the Web as a medium lies partly in the peculiar practices that grant different statuses to information sources.

We argue that issue publics on Facebook come into being through a specific set of double articulations of code and politics that link and reshape informational processes, communicational constraints and possibilities, and political practices in different and sometimes contradictory ways. Using Maurizio Lazzarato\u2019s exploration of immaterial labour (2004), we demonstrate the need to further understand the networking of publics and their issues by considering how online platforms provide the material, communicational, and social means for a public to exist and therefore define the parameters for assembling issues and publics and circumscribe a horizon of political agency.

But media governance research seems to have a blind spot: the information and communication technologies that media communication relies upon. The focus on constructivist approaches to technology in social sciences has neglected the \u201cpolitics of information and communication technologies\u201d in two ways: First, there is a politics in technologies itself in the sense that their very design facilitates, controls and constrains social behaviour. Second, the development of new technologies and their reconfiguration do not follow any technological logic but is itself politically and socially contested. This article links approaches and insights from science and technology studies with the governance perspective in order to conceptualize the role of technology in media governance constellations beyond determinism. This allows conceiving technical architectures as essential and shapeable elements of the institutional environment that facilitates and constrains the range of behaviour (and preferences) of actors. Current policy debates about net neutrality, copyrights and access blocking are not explicable without taken technology both as an object as well as an institutionalized element of media governance into account.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 116, "citationCount": 19, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "25855489", "name": "Christian Katzenbach"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citedPaper": {"paperId": "b1582d579471383dd677290ef4400d3d8495a839", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2304969025"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1582d579471383dd677290ef4400d3d8495a839", "title": "Popping Up and Fading Out: Participatory Networks and Istanbul\u2019s Creative City Project", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 16, "citationCount": 76, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3016390", "name": "Rolien Hoyng"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["Some critics of the field of media sociology (from which the bulk of media institutions research has emerged) have contended that the field \u201clargely stalled\u201d after the many path breaking institutional analyses of news organizations in the 1970s and 1980s (Kaplan, 2006, p. 173)."], "isInfluential": false, "citedPaper": {"paperId": "ba94db4d88750f4f772df3d1d4bf45f9b34887cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2030190030", "DOI": "10.1080/10584600600629737"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba94db4d88750f4f772df3d1d4bf45f9b34887cc", "title": "The News About New Institutionalism: Journalism's Ethic of Objectivity and Its Political Origins", "abstract": "The author discusses the utility of sociology's new institutionalism (NI) in organizational theory for the study of journalism and contends that NI remedies the political and cultural deficits in most existing social theories of the news.

The public journalism movement believed in a form of democracy that was conversational and deliberative; in contrast, traditional journalism embraced an aggregative understanding of democracy, while Indymedia's democratic vision could best be seen as agonistic in nature.

The piece concludes by discussing how this relates to work on Web 2.0 and how this work might be developed in the future.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 563, "influentialCitationCount": 50, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144145182", "name": "David Beer"}]}}, {"intents": ["methodology"], "contexts": ["Lessig (2006) employed this analogy to illustrate the ways in which the programming that controls the operation of communications networks and platforms is a powerful tool for regulating the behavior of users in ways that are not always obvious."], "isInfluential": false, "citedPaper": {"paperId": "e74e34dc50982ebc8df913498061f4bebb6c490b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2170048845"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e74e34dc50982ebc8df913498061f4bebb6c490b", "title": "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace", "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nShould cyberspace be regulated? How can it be done? It's a cherished belief of techies and net denizens everywhere that cyberspace is fundamentally impossible to regulate. Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig warns that, if we're not careful we'll wake up one day to discover that the character of cyberspace has changed from under us. Cyberspace will no longer be a world of relative freedom; instead it will be a world of perfect control where our identities, actions, and desires are monitored, tracked, and analyzed for the latest market research report. Commercial forces will dictate the change, and architecture\u0097the very structure of cyberspace itself\u0097will dictate the form our interactions can and cannot take. \nCode And Other Laws of Cyberspace is an exciting examination of how the core values of cyberspace as we know it\u0097intellectual property, free speech, and privacy-\u0097are being threatened and what we can do to protect them. Lessig shows how code\u0097the architecture and law of cyberspace\u0097can make a domain, site, or network free or restrictive; how technological architectures influence people's behavior and the values they adopt; and how changes in code can have damaging consequences for individual freedoms.

If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items. We find that users rate fairly consistently across rating scales. Users can be manipulated, though, tending to rate toward the prediction the system shows, whether the prediction is accurate or not.

A: Were used to thinking of the Internet like an enormous library, with services like Google providing a universal map. But thats no longer really the case. Sites from Google and Facebook to Yahoo News and the New York Times are now increasingly personalized based on your web history, they filter information to show you the stuff they think you want to see. That can be very different from what everyone else sees or from what we need to see. Your filter bubble is this unique, personal universe of information created just for you by this array of personalizing filters. Its invisible and its becoming more and more difficult to escape. Q: I like the idea that websites might show me information relevant to my interestsit can be overwhelming how much information is available I already only watch TV shows and listen to radio programs that are known to have my same political leaning. Whats so bad about this? A: Its true: Weve always selected information sources that accord with our own views. But one of the creepy things about the filter bubble is that were not really doing the selecting. When you turn on Fox News or MSNBC, you have a sense of what their editorial sensibility is: Fox isnt going to show many stories that portray Obama in a good light, and MSNBC isnt going to the ones that portray him badly. Personalized filters are a different story: You dont know who they think you are or on what basis theyre showing you what theyre showing. And as a result, you dont really have any sense of whats getting edited out or, in fact, that things are being edited out at all. Q: How does money fit into this picture? A: The rush to build the filter bubble is absolutely driven by commercial interests. Its becoming clearer and clearer that if you want to have lots of people use your website, you need to provide them with personally relevant information, and if you want to make the most money on ads, you need to provide them with relevant ads. This has triggered a personal information gold rush, in which the major companies Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, and the like are competing to create the most comprehensive portrait of each of us to drive personalized products. Theres also a whole behavior market opening up in which every action you take online every mouse click, every form entry can be sold as a commodity. Q: What is the Internet hiding from me? A: As Google engineer Jonathan McPhie explained to me, its different for every person and in fact, even Google doesnt totally know how it plays out on an individual level. At an aggregate level, they can see that people are clicking more. But they cant predict how each individuals information environment is altered. In general, the things that are most likely to get edited out are the things youre least likely to click on. Sometimes, this can be a real service if you never read articles about sports, why should a newspaper put a football story on your front page? But apply the same logic to, say, stories about foreign policy, and a problem starts to emerge. Some things, like homelessness or genocide, arent highly clickable but are highly important. Q: Which companies or Websites are personalizing like this? A: In one form or another, nearly every major website on the Internet is flirting with personalization. But the one that surprises people most is Google. If you and I Google the same thing at the same time, we may get very different results. Google tracks hundreds of signals about each of us what kind of computer were on, what weve searched for in the past, even how long it takes us to decide what to click on and uses it to customize our results. When the result is that our favorite pizza parlor shows up first when we Google pizza, its useful. But when the result is that we only see the information that is aligned with our religious or social or political beliefs, its difficult to maintain perspective. Q: Are any sites being transparent about their personalization? A: Some sites do better than others. Amazon, for example, is often quite transparent about the personalization it does: Were showing you Brave New World because you bought 1984. But its one thing to personalize products and another to personalize whole information flows, like Google and Facebook are doing. And very few users of those services are even marginally aware that this kind of filtering is at work. Q: Does this issue of personalization impact my privacy or jeopardize my identity at all? A: Research psychologists have known for a while that the media you consume shapes your identity. So when the media you consume is also shaped by your identity, you can slip into a weird feedback loop. A lot of people see a simple version of this on Facebook: You idly click on an old classmate, Facebook reads that as a friendship, and pretty soon youre seeing every one of John or Sues posts. Gone awry, personalization can create compulsive media media targeted to appeal to your personal psychological weak spots. You can find yourself eating the equivalent of information junk food instead of having a more balanced information diet. Q: You make it clear that while most Websites user agreements say they wont share our personal information, they also maintain the right to change the rules at any time. Do you foresee sites changing those rules to profit from our online personas? A: They already have. Facebook, for example, is notorious for its bait-and-switch tactics when it comes to privacy. For a long time, what you Liked on Facebook was private, and the site promised to keep it that way. Then, overnight, they made that information public to the world, in order to make it easier for their advertisers to target specific subgroups. Theres an irony in the fact that while Rolex needs to get Tom Cruises permission to put his face on a billboard, it doesnt need to get my permission to advertise my endorsement to my friends on Facebook. We need laws that give people more rights in their personal data. Q: Is there any way to avoid this personalization? What if Im not logged into a site? A: Even if youre not logged into Google, for example, an engineer told me there are 57 signals that the site uses to figure out who you are: whether youre on a Mac or PC or iPad, where youre located when youre Googling, etc. And in the near future, itll be possible to fingerprint unique devices, so that sites can tell which individual computer youre using. Thats why erasing your browser cookies is at best a partial solutionit only partially limits the information available to personalizers. What we really need is for the companies that power the filter bubble to take responsibility for the immense power they now have the power to determine what we see and dont see, what we know and dont know. We need them to make sure we continue to have access to public discourse and a view of the common good. A world based solely on things we Like is a very incomplete world. Im optimistic that they can. Its worth remembering that newspapers werent always informed by a sense of journalistic ethics. They existed for centuries without it. It was only when critics like Walter Lippman began to point out how important they were that the newspapers began to change. And while journalistic ethics arent perfect, because of them we have been better informed over the last century. We need algorithmic ethics to guide us through the next. Q: What are the business leaders at Google and Facebook and Yahoo saying about their responsibilities? A: To be honest, theyre frustratingly coy. They tend to frame the trend in the passive tense: Googles Eric Schmidt recently said It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them, rather than Google is making it very hard Mark Zuckerberg perfectly summed up the tension in personalization when he said A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa. But he refuses to engage with what that means at a societal level especially for the people in Africa. Q: Your background is as a political organizer for the liberal Website MoveOn.org. How does that experience inform your book? A: Ive always believed the Internet could connect us all together and help create a better, more democratic world. Thats what excited me about MoveOn here we were, connecting people directly with each other and with political leaders to create change. But that more democratic society has yet to emerge, and I think its partly because while the Internet is very good at helping groups of people with like interests band together (like MoveOn), its not so hot at introducing people to different people and ideas. Democracy requires discourse and personalization is making that more and more elusive. And that worries me, because we really need the Internet to live up to that connective promise. We need it to help us solve global problems like climate change, terrorism, or natural resource management which by their nature require massive coordination, and great wisdom and ingenuity. These problems cant be solved by a person or two they require whole societies to participate.

The evidence presented here suggests that resources in search engine development are overwhelmingly allocated on the basis of market factors or scientific/technological concerns. Fairness and representativeness, core elements of the journalists\u2019 definition of quality media content, are not key determiners of search engine quality in the minds of search engine producers. Rather, alternative standards of quality, such as customer satisfaction and relevance, mean that tactics to silence or promote certain websites or site owners (such as blacklisting, whitelisting, and index \u201ccleaning\u201d) are seen as unproblematic.", "venue": "J.
