By Sarah Wakefield and Christopher Wildeman. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. 231 pp. $34.95 doth.In his majority opinion in United States v. Windsor (2013), Justice Anthony Kennedy offered a novel argument for invalidating the federal refusal to recognize same-sex marriages. The Defense of Marriage Act, Kennedy explained, humiliates children raised by same-sex couples. Many regulatory schemes, whether civil or criminal, have spillover effects onto the children of regulated subjects. Judicial acknowledgement of those effects in the same-sex marriage context, however, contrasts strikingly with the judicial incuriosity about parallel effects in other domains, particularly in the criminal law.Since the 1970s, the United States has experienced explosive growth in incarceration. Mass incarceration unequally affects different racial groups. Black men lacking a high school diploma are more than five times more likely to be incarcerated, for example, than similarly situated white men (p. 15). One in four black children in the 1990 cohort experienced paternal incarceration (p. 41). Does mass incarceration humiliate, or inflict worse harms, on children? And does the effect differ by racial group in ways that influence larger patterns of racial inequality?The answers are not obvious. The incarcerated population is drawn from a relatively narrow slice of the left-tail of the income distribution. Its direct effect on inequality is tightly bounded. Western, for example, estimated the effect of incarceration on the gap between black and white earnings to be around three percent (Western 2006). Further, parental incarceration might have no effect if it is caused by the same underlying factors that cause other undesirable childhood outcomes (e.g., poverty, health problems, and homelessness). Alternatively, parental incarceration might enhance the welfare of children by removing a source of violent risk and criminality from the household.Documenting the causal effect of parental incarceration on childhood outcomes raises nettlesome methodological problems: Randomized experiments are out of bounds. Few large-scale data-sets contain extensive longitudinal evidence. Existing data presents significant identification problems. The central contribution of Children of the Prison Boom is the application of sophisticated econometric methodologies to a range of national and city-level data to generate deeply sobering evidence of incarceration's devastating effect on children, and in particular African-American children. Focusing on the causal effects of (largely paternal) incarceration on children's mental health, behavioral outcomes, homelessness, and infant mortality, Wakefield and Wildeman also persuasively demonstrate that mass incarceration is a significant causal pathway for the intergenerational reproduction of racial inequality.To generate estimates of parental incarceration's causal effects, Wakefield and Wildeman rely on three large longitudinal datagathering efforts: the twenty-city Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, the single-city Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and the multistate Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Systems. Longitudinal data allows them to deploy propensity-score matching, within-person change models, and synthetic regressions to estimate the average effect of parental incarceration on outcomes of interest. In respect to each independent variable of interest, Wakefield and Wildeman apply different methods and present several model specifications. By generating estimates of causal effects that are robust to both method and model specification, they generate powerful evidence of causality. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 1, "citationCount": 120, "influentialCitationCount": 11, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "115254703", "name": "Aziz Z Huq"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": ["\u2026theory, extending the relationship between the stigma of criminal justice contact and inequality into the digital age (Becker 1963; Brayne 2014; Goffman 2014; Goffman 1963; Kohler-Hausmann 2013; Lyon 2006; Pager 2007; Rios 2011; Stuart 2016; Wakefield and Wildeman 2013; Western and Pettit 2005)."], "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "14219ee48a58681c96c59685da7e93724851cd9f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1502766477", "DOI": "10.1086/432780"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14219ee48a58681c96c59685da7e93724851cd9f", "title": "Black\u2010White Wage Inequality, Employment Rates, and Incarceration1", "abstract": "The observed gap in average wages between black men and white men inadequately reflects the relative economic standing of blacks, who suffer from a high rate of joblessness.

Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin) reputations, decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire economy. Shrouded in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks, whistleblowers, and legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment.

But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm\u2019s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law \u2014 more particularly, through Title VII\u2019s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining\u2019s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others\u2019 discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying dataAddressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data\u2019s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cfairness.\u201d", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 15, "citationCount": 1350, "influentialCitationCount": 67, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2881033", "name": "Solon Barocas"}, {"authorId": "46432110", "name": "Andrew D.

They constitute 47% of the 1,900 exonerations listed in the National Registry of Exonerations (as of October 2016), and the great majority of more than 1,800 additional innocent defendants who were framed and convicted of crimes in 15 large-scale police scandals and later cleared in \" group exonerations. \" We see this racial disparity for all major crime categories, but we examine it in this report in the context of the three types of crime that produce the largest numbers of exonerations in the Registry: murder, sexual assault, and drug crimes. I. Murder \u2022 Judging from exonerations, innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. A major cause of the high number of black murder exonerations is the high homicide rate in the black community\u2014a tragedy that kills many African Americans and sends many others to prison. Innocent defendants who are falsely convicted and exonerated do not contribute to this high homicide rate. They\u2014 like the families of victims who are killed\u2014are deeply harmed by murders committed by others. \u2022 African-American prisoners who are convicted of murder are about 50% more likely to be innocent than other convicted murderers. Part of that disparity is tied to the race of the victim. African Americans imprisoned for murder are more likely to be innocent if they were convicted of killing white victims. Only about 15% of murders by African Americans have white victims, but 31% of innocent African-American murder exonerees were convicted of killing white people. \u2022 The convictions that led to murder exonerations with black defendants were 22% more likely to include misconduct by police officers than those with white defendants. In addition, on average black murder exonerees spent three years longer in prison before release than white murder exonerees, and those sentenced to death spent four years longer. \u2022 Many of the convictions of African-American murder exonerees were affected by a wide range of types of racial discrimination, from unconscious bias and institutional discrimination to explicit racism. \u2022 Most wrongful convictions are never discovered.

Arguing that the current public conversation about surveillance and privacy rights is rife with political and conceptual failings, Gilliom goes beyond the critics and analysts to add fresh voices, insights, and perspectives. This powerful book lets us in on the conversations of low-income mothers from Appalachian Ohio as they talk about the welfare bureaucracy and its remarkably advanced surveillance system. In their struggle to care for their families, these women are monitored and assessed through a vast network of supercomputers, caseworkers, fraud control agents, and even grocers and neighbors. In-depth interviews show that these women focus less on the right to privacy than on a critique of surveillance that lays bare the personal and political conflicts with which they live. And, while they have little interest in conventional forms of politics, we see widespread patterns of everyday resistance as they subvert the surveillance regime when they feel it prevents them from being good parents. Ultimately, \"Overseers of the Poor\" demonstrates the need to reconceive not just our understanding of the surveillance-privacy debate but also the broader realms of language, participation, and the politics of rights. We all know that our lives are being watched more than ever before.

The main protagonists are the cultural elites involved in the elaboration of new state-sponsored mass-spectacle national holidays: Navro\u2019z (Zoroastrian New Year) and Independence Day. The overall argument is that despite their aspirations to reinvigorate national identity, mass spectacle creators in Uzbekistan have reproduced much of the Soviet cultural production. National identity has been one of the most fraught questions in Central Asia, where nationality was a contradictory and complicated product of the Soviet rule. Although the category of nationality was initiated, produced, and imposed by the Soviet state in the 1920s, it eventually became a source of power and authority for local elites, including cultural producers. The collapse of the Soviet Union opened up possibilities for revising and reversing many understandings manufactured by the socialist regime. Yet, upon her arrival in Tashkent to conduct her research on the renegotiation of national identity in 1995, Laura Adams discovered that instead of embracing newly-found freedom to recover a more authentic history, most Uzbek intellectuals, especially cultural producers working with the state, avoided probing too far in this direction. Rather than entirely discarding the Soviet colonial legacies, they revised their history selectively. Whereas the ideological content of their cultural production shifted from socialism to nationalism, many of the previous cultural \u2018\u2018forms\u2019\u2019 have remained. Similarly, the Uzbek government continued to employ cultural elites to implement the task of reinforcing its nation-building program, thus following the Soviet model of cultural production. The book consists of four chapters. The first chapter delineates the broad themes of national identity building, and the remaining chapters explore mass spectacle creation by distinguishing between three elements: form (Chapter Two), content (Chapter Three), and the mode of production (Chapter Four). The study is based on content analysis of two Olympic Games-style national holidays, interviews with cultural producers, and participation observation of festivals and behind-the-scenes preparation meetings. Although Adams provides a few references to viewers and their attitude toward the public holiday performances, her book does not offer an extended engagement with reception and consumption of these holidays. The comprehensive and multi-layered overview of the process of revising national identity in Uzbekistan is one of the book\u2019s major accomplishments. For Adams, the production of national identity is not a selfevident and seamless production forced by the state but instead a dynamic, complex, and dialogical process of negotiation between various parties (intellectual factions, state officials, mass spectacle producers, etc.). Her account reveals the messy and often contradictory nature of national identity production and thus moves away from the tendency to reify the state and its policies. The book makes a significant contribution to studies of nationalism by suggesting that the production of national identity in Uzbekistan was centrally constituted by the consideration of the \u2018\u2018international audience.\u2019\u2019 Although public holidays, studied by Adams, aimed at fostering national identification, the forms in which these celebrations are performed (including national dances and music) indicate the aspiration of cultural producers to be part of the international community. This kind of national production self-consciously oriented toward the international viewer has been the legacy of the Soviet nationalities policy where all cultural producers had to produce art \u2018\u2018socialist in content, national in form.\u2019\u2019 Notwithstanding the difference in generations or genres,", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 17, "citationCount": 53, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "114751162", "name": "C.

Relying on a survey of American police departments conducted by the Police Foundation, we examine the diffusion of Compstat programs and the nature of Compstat models throughout the United States. We also assess the penetration of models of strategic problem solving more generally into American policing. Our findings document a process of \u201cdiffusion of innovation\u201d of Compstat-like programs in larger police agencies that follows a rapid pace. At the same time, our data suggest that many elements of strategic problem solving had begun to be implemented more widely across American police agencies before the emergence of Compstat as a programmatic entity, and that such elements have been adopted broadly even by departments that have not formally adopted a Compstat program. \n \nPolicy Implications: \nCompstat holds out the promise of allowing police agencies to adopt innovative technologies and problem-solving techniques while empowering traditional police organizational structures. However, our analysis suggests that at this stage, what most characterizes Compstat departments and distinguishes them from others is the development of the control element of this reform. This leads us to question whether the rapid rise of Compstat in American police agencies can be interpreted more as an effort to maintain and reinforce the \u201cbureaucratic\u201d or \u201cparamilitary\u201d model of police organization (that has been under attack by scholars for most of the last two decades) than as an attempt to truly reform models of American policing.", "venue": "", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 66, "citationCount": 340, "influentialCitationCount": 18, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49867623", "name": "D.

We argue that in the neoliberal era market institutions increasingly use actuarial techniques to split and sort individuals into classification situations that shape life-chances. While this is a general and increasingly pervasive process, our main empirical illustration comes from the transformation of the credit market in the United States. This market works as both as a leveling force and as a condenser of new forms of social difference. The U.S. banking and credit system has greatly broadened its scope over the past twenty years to incorporate previously excluded groups. We observe this leveling tendency in the expansion of credit amongst lower-income households, the systematization of overdraft protections, and the unexpected and rapid growth of the fringe banking sector. But while access to credit has democratized, it has also differentiated. Scoring technologies classify and price people according to credit risk. This has allowed multiple new distinctions to be made amongst the creditworthy, as scores get attached to different interest rates and loan structures.

We argue that in the neoliberal era market institutions increasingly use actuarial techniques to split and sort individuals into classification situations that shape life-chances. While this is a general and increasingly pervasive process, our main empirical illustration comes from the transformation of the credit market in the United States. This market works as both as a leveling force and as a condenser of new forms of social difference. The U.S. banking and credit system has greatly broadened its scope over the past twenty years to incorporate previously excluded groups. We observe this leveling tendency in the expansion of credit amongst lower-income households, the systematization of overdraft protections, and the unexpected and rapid growth of the fringe banking sector. But while access to credit has democratized, it has also differentiated. Scoring technologies classify and price people according to credit risk. This has allowed multiple new distinctions to be made amongst the creditworthy, as scores get attached to different interest rates and loan structures. Scores have also expanded into markets beyond consumer credit, such as insurance, real estate, employment, and elsewhere. The result is a cumulative pattern of advantage and disadvantage with both objectively measured and subjectively experienced aspects.

Arrest quotas and high-tech surveillance techniques criminalize entire blocks, and transform the very associations that should stabilize young lives-family, relationships, jobs - into liabilities, as the police use such relationships to track down suspects, demand information, and threaten consequences. Alice Goffman spent six years living in one such neighborhood in Philadelphia, and her close observations and often harrowing stories reveal the pernicious effects of this pervasive policing.

While not denying the problems of the drug trade, and the violence that often accompanies it, through her gripping accounts of daily life in the forgotten neighborhoods of America's cities, Goffman makes it impossible for us to ignore the very real human costs of our failed response-the blighting of entire neighborhoods and the needless sacrifice of whole generations.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 421, "influentialCitationCount": 14, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "114920406", "name": "A.

Canadian criminals put in more time in jail per dollar stolen in other countries, although these statistics predate the conviction of Alan Eagleson. Another statistic, even less likely to stir patriotic pride, is that Canadian youth, as Bernard Schissel points out, have the highest per capita rate of incarceration of any country in the world.If crime rates in Canada have dropped off in recent years, corresponding to the diminishing ratio of youth in the Canadian population, we still have a lot more lawyers. Prior to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Canadians had less than half as many lawyers per capita as the Americans but now we approach two-thirds of the American ratio (Law and Markets 77-81) creating \"the danger of supply-driven and socially harmful increases in litigation\" (85). Virtually, all of the contributors to Law and Markets bemoan Canada's increasing litigiousness; none defend the very quality that brought one of Canada's most honoured citizens to jail. The Fraser Institute has brought together an interesting volume that seems to bear the message of Adam Egoyan's movie The Sweet Hereafter; namely, that lawyers as ambulance-chasers are bad news. Law and Markets is concerned not with corporate criminality but with the prospect that enterprising lawyers, instigating class action suits on contingency fees, will be able to dupe civil juries, and cut into profit margins. Indeed, Richard Hazelton, the CEO of Dow Corning which filed for bankruptcy because of the silicone breast implant suit, tells a cautionary tale for Canadian businesspeople.Contributors point out that jurors lack competence to assess the scientific and technical evidence about toxic emissions, risks to health, the relationship of causality and legal accountability; prejudices about dioxin spills may skew assessment of the personal injury caused by the spillage. The one exception to the anti-litigation view of the 17 contributors to Law and Markets is Mark Mattson, an environmental litigator, who argues convincingly that the Canadian Environmental Protection Act needs radical revision or abolition. Mattson argues that the federal government should either enforce environmental standards or leave private litigators like himself to engage in civil ligation against environmental polluters. Mattson recommends that public interest groups and their lawyers split the fine levied on the offending corporations or municipalities (135). While Mattson may conform to the Fraser Institute's policy on deregulation -- \"It is government intervention that stands in the way of a public right to protect community resources\" (136) -- his proposals would encourage litigation, diminish shareholder profits and raise citizens' taxes. If the aim of Canadian economic regulation is, as Konrad von Finckenstein puts it, \"user-friendly regulation,\" we are led to conclude that deregulation and user-friendly regulation are not the same thing. If the conflicting interests of Richard Hazelton and Mark Mattson reveal the current contradictions of capitalism, we might also note that the provinces geographically and ideologically closest to the Fraser Institute (British Columbia and Alberta) are the most litigious, while New Brunswick are Newfoundland are least litigious (158-9).An exciting challenge for the Fraser Institute would be to take on the human rights legislation that emerged after the Second World War, arising from a combination of anti-Nazi principle, Keynesian welfarism and acceptance of wartime control of goods and services in the public interest. Since human rights codes abridge several common law rights, of property and contract, specifically the right of business to discriminate in favour of preferred employees, buyers, tenants and customers, the Institute's views on James Walker's compelling account of the role of human rights legislation in limiting racism in the Canadian marketplace would be illuminating. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 1997, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1112, "influentialCitationCount": 52, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48497568", "name": "R.

Information dragnets increasingly yield huge quantities of individual-level data, which are analyzed to sort and slot people into categories of taste, riskiness or worth. These tools deepen the reach of the market and define new strategies of profit-making. We present a new theoretical framework for understanding their development. We argue that (a) modern organ- izations follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as possible; (b) as a result of the analysis and use of this data, individuals accrue a form of capital flowing from their positions as measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and (c) the facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices with potentially stratifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in product and service markets. We dis- cuss the implications of these processes and argue that they tend toward a new economy of moral judgment, where outcomes are experienced as morally deserved positions based on prior good actions and good tastes, as measured and classified by this new infrastructure of data collection and analysis. Key words: classification, big data, technology, markets, institutions, morality JEL classification: A13, O33 Across institutional domains, tracking and measurement is expanding and becoming ever more fine-grained (Limn, 2012; Gillespie et al., 2014; Pasquale, 2015). We see it in everyday consumption, in housing and credit markets, in health, employment, education (Cottom, 2016), social relations, including intimate ones (Levy, 2015), legal services, and even into political life (Ziewitz, 2016) and the private sphere (Neff and Nafus, 2016). Sociologists studying the state, technology and the market have sought to describe and understand these trends in different ways. This article proposes a framework to analytically unify their con- cerns, and to grasp the implications of contemporary technological developments for proc- esses of inequality and stratification.

As a general matter, the suspicion derives from information a police officer observes or knows. It is individualized to a particular person at a particular place. Most reasonable suspicion cases involve police confronting unknown suspects engaged in observable suspicious activities. Essentially, the reasonable suspicion doctrine is based on \u201csmall data\u201d \u2013 discrete facts involving limited information and little knowledge about the suspect. But what if this small data is replaced by \u201cbig data\u201d? What if police can \u201cknow\u201d about the suspect through new networked information sources? Or, what if predictive analytics can forecast who will be the likely troublemakers in a community? The rise of big data technology offers a challenge to the traditional paradigm of Fourth Amendment law. Now, with little effort, most unknown suspects can be \u201cknown,\u201d as a web of information can identify and provide extensive personal data about a suspect independent of the officer\u2019s observations. New data sources including law enforcement databases, third party information sources (phone records, rental records, GPS data, video surveillance data, etc.), and predictive analytics, combined with biometric or facial recognition software, means that information about that suspect can be known in a few data searches. At some point, the data (independent of the observation) may become sufficiently individualized and predictive to justify the seizure of a suspect. The question this article poses is can a Fourth Amendment stop be predicated on the aggregation of specific, individualized, but otherwise non-criminal factors?This article traces the consequences in the shift from a \u201csmall data\u201d reasonable suspicion doctrine, focused on specific, observable actions of unknown suspects, to the \u201cbig data\u201d reality of an interconnected information rich world of known suspects. With more targeted information, police officers on the streets will have a stronger predictive sense about the likelihood that they are observing criminal activity. This evolution, however, only hints at the promise of big data policing. The next phase will be using existing predictive analytics to target suspects without any actual observation of criminal activity, merely relying on the accumulation of various data points. Unknown suspects will become known, not because of who they are but because of the data they left behind. Using pattern matching techniques through networked databases, individuals will be targeted out of the vast flow of informational data. This new reality subverts reasonable suspicion from being a source of protection against unreasonable stops, to a means of justifying those same stops.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount": 58, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2006734908", "name": "A.

Yet, despite such long-standing theoretical links between neighborhoods and social networks, empirical research rarely considers or measures dimensions of geography and social network mechanisms simultaneously. The present study seeks to fill this gap by analyzing how both geography and social networks influence an important social problem in urban America: gang violence. Using detailed data on fatal and non-fatal shootings, we examine effects of geographic proximity, organizational memory, and additional group processes (e.g., reciprocity, transitivity, and status seeking) on gang violence in Chicago and Boston. Results show adjacency of gang turf and prior conflict between gangs are strong predictors of subsequent gang violence. Furthermore, important network processes, including reciprocity and status seeking, also contribute to observed patterns of gang violence. In fact, we find that these spatial and network processes mediate racial effects, suggesting the primacy of place and the group in generating gang violence.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 97, "citationCount": 282, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2336642", "name": "A.

In emphasizing the existence of a diversity of masculinities, she claims that \u2018\u2018different routes to change\u2019\u2019 (p. 10) can impact the hegemonic standard. She is, in a sense, deconstructing the homogeneous form of hegemonic masculinity to show that change is possible by conveying how \u2018\u2018complicit\u2019\u2019 men produce alternative versions of masculinity based on an individualized experience, as opposed to historical institutionalized beliefs. She utilizes multiple methods from different data sources, which strengthen the claims that the diversity of masculine performances within the \u2018\u2018private\u2019\u2019 sphere are impacted by social and familial changes. While Chapter Four derives from cross-cultural data, the final two chapters (Five and Six) are based on data drawn from men in Portugal, which limits specific application in other cultures, but is extremely useful when discussing change in general. Whether it is factor analysis of cross-cultural quantitative data concerning attitudes of the breadwinner role versus practices of work in the home (Chapter Four) or qualitative interviews with men as they respond to changes in family structures (Chapter Five), Aboim\u2019s findings emphasize how gender expectations are slow to change even as the structure and organization of the family changes. Furthermore in Chapter Six, her qualitative analysis of sexuality and gender roles claims that, over time, expectations are changing about men\u2019s and women\u2019s roles in sexual relations (albeit slowly) which she argues impacts the hegemonic standard. Developing masculinities are hybrid masculinities, offering alternative masculinities that borrow from feminine experiences. The text exhibits that changes in masculine expectations and displays are apparent and they are linked to societal change, which impacts the gender order. Her use of multiple methods offers strong credibility to her claims, as each finding supports the overall idea. Although the interpretation of hybrid masculinities cannot be challenged, it can be debated. Throughout the text, Aboim demonstrates a complete understanding of the field, drawing on a range of theoretical ideas to express an inclusive discussion about the topic of masculinities, often moving beyond masculinity studies, and even feminist theories. In Chapter One, she offers a brief history of the development of the field to establish the context of her argument. The author, however, extends the discussion beyond the gender field, locating it within larger sociological discussions. For example, she reviews discussions of family (Chapter Three) and domination and hegemony (Chapter Two), allowing readers to comprehend the basis of her argument and the theoretical underpinnings that have helped to develop the ideas. This is a great tool for any graduate student who is interested in the field. But Aboim\u2019s extensive theoretical development also appears to be a key limitation in the book. Although all aspects of the theories appear to be applicable to the discussion, the thorough discussion leads a reader to get mired in the theoretical discussions, losing focus on the key points the author is attempting to convey. The author dedicates the entirety of Chapter Three to justify family, or at least the \u2018\u2018private\u2019\u2019 sphere, as an important venue for discussion, setting up the following three chapters. The author engages the discussion of the separation of spheres, which is interesting and thorough, but does not explicitly identify which aspects of it are relevant, nor does she offer examples to help the reader follow the context of the discussion.

Various terms are used to describe the practice including streaming, setting and tracking, the meanings of which can vary from context to context. The generic term of ability grouping will be used to describe the practice where students of perceived similar achievement levels are placed in the same classroom or group. Mathematics teachers are more likely to support homogeneous grouping than their colleagues in other discipline areas. Cahan and Linchevski (1996) cite figures from the UK where 80% of mathematics teachers believe that it is inappropriate to have mixed ability teaching groups whereas, in contrast, 16% of science teachers and 3% of English teachers held the same view. Ruthven (1987) reported similar trends in primary school where ability grouping was a \u2018predominant form of organisation in mathematics... [but] was largely unknown in areas such as science and social studies\u2019 (p. 243). Ruthven also goes on to say that ability grouping remains consistent in mathematics but diminishes in other areas as students move through the year levels. While teachers generally may support practices of ability grouping, there is some evidence that parents also value such practices, particularly middle-class parents (Boaler, 1997). Such studies raise questions as to why mathematics teachers, unlike their peers in other discipline areas, support notions of ability grouping to such an extent. Indeed, if ability were an innate construct, it would seem logical that students would have either generalised or specialised abilities across disciplines and yet this ideology does not seem to be supported by teachers other than in mathematics. The reasons for mathematics teachers supporting ability grouping are varied, but can be tied to a belief that sees mathematics as a hierarchical discipline where concepts build on previous concepts (Ruthven, 1987).

Format: Hardcover book (softcover also available). Audience: Physicians and nonphysicians involved in developing or setting policy for classification systems, nomenclatures, or vocabularies. Purpose: To discuss the idea that classifications and standardizations have direct impact on social and political aspects of human interaction. Content: The authors organize their presentation into an introductory chapter that frames the issues, followed by three sections (classification and large-scale infrastructures, classification and biography, and classification and work practice) providing specific examples, and a conclusion section. The authors use the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, race classification under apartheid in South Africa, and the Nursing Intervention Classification as primary examples. An extensive bibliography of more than 300 references, a name index, and a subject index follow the text. Highlights: The authors present fascinating history and insights into the development of various classification systems. In addition, they identify issues that arise during the creation of any classification system, such as the need to compromise between providing granular classifications that satisfy needs specific to a time and place. Finally, the authors draw attention to the implications of choices made in the development of some important classification systems. These implications bear on moral judgments, financial effects, and political gains or losses. Limitations: The authors' writing style hinder the reader's ability to access the interesting information and to understand the implications of choices made in developing classification systems. While the overall organization of the book is clear, the themes and ideas do not flow well. Sentences require repeated readings, and a dictionary at your side would be helpful, given the authors' frequent use of unfamiliar words.

These attributes give rise to three challenges for policing and national security. First, the decentralized and localized nature of American policing creates enormous organizational problems in coordinating national security activities, and combating terrorism in particular. Second, the counter-terrorism agenda may influence or disrupt systems and patterns of political accountability of local police agencies. Third, some of the same attributes of local policing that makes it a useful counter-terrorism tool also create difficulties in effectively carrying out more traditional functions. The tension that sometimes exists between law enforcement efforts to prosecute criminals and secret intelligence activities to monitor them is exacerbated when stretched across local-federal lines, and some actions that may be important from a national security perspective may also be disruptive to more traditional law and order police efforts within localized communities.

Drawing from characteristics of the technology, the data collection process and the nature of the data, this article identifies 28 dimensions that are useful in characterizing means of surveillance. These dimensions highlight the differences between the new and traditional surveillance and offer a way to capture major sources of variation relevant to contemporary social, ethical and policy considerations. There can be little doubt that major changes have occurred. However the normative implications of this are mixed and dependent on the technology in question and evaluative framework. The concept of surveillance slack is introduced. This involves the extent to which a technology is applied, rather than the absolute amount of surveillance.

For instance, what evidence is provided by the Gettier thought experiment against the JTB theory of knowledge? According to one view, it provides as evidence only a certain psychological proposition, e.g. that it seems to one that the subject in the Gettier case lacks knowledge. On an alternative, nonpsychological view, the Gettier thought experiment provides as evidence the nonpsychological proposition that the subject in the Gettier case lacks knowledge (e.g., Williamson 2007). Given the centrality of thought experiments to philosophical enquiry, the correct account of thought experiment evidence is important for understanding the nature of philosophical methodology. Further, Williamson argues that a misguided adherence to the psychological view of thought experiment evidence encourages scepticism about philosophy since it opens a gap between our evidence and the nonpsychological subject matter of philosophy. The main aim of this paper is to defend the psychological view against recent objections. In particular, I argue that even if thought experiment evidence is psychological, it can still provide justification for non-psychological claims which are the subject matter of philosophy.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 29, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2110862089", "name": "Jessica Brown"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": ["By contrast, the institutional\nperspective (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Meyer and Rowan 1977) questions the assumption that organizational structures stem from rational processes or technical imperatives (Scott 2004)."], "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "bc4c52775dde0e372e440a85de2b6c19ed696bfc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "76034536", "DOI": "10.1086/226550"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc4c52775dde0e372e440a85de2b6c19ed696bfc", "title": "Institutionalized Organizations: Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony", "abstract": "Many formal organizational structures arise as reflections of rationalized institutional rules.

The rise of paternalism has promoted a more directive and supervisory approach to managing the poor. This has intersected with a second development: the rise of neoliberalism as an organizing principle of governance. Neoliberals have redesigned state operations around market principles; to impose market discipline, core state functions - from war to welfare - have been contracted out to private providers. The authors seek to clarify the origins, operations, and consequences of neoliberal paternalism as a mode of poverty governance, tracing its impact from the federal level, to the state and county level, down to the differences in ways frontline case workers take disciplinary actions in individual cases.

However, current theories of technology and organizational form are insensitive to the potential number of structural variations implicit in role-based change. This paper expands recent sociological thought on the link between institution and action to outline a theory of how technology might occasion different organizational structures by altering institutionalized roles and patterns of interaction. In so doing, technology is treated as a social rather than a physical object, and structure is conceptualized as a process rather than an entity. The implications of the theory are illustrated by showing how identical CT scanners occasioned similar structuring processes in two radiology departments and yet led to divergent forms of organization. The data suggest that to understand how technologies alter organizational structures researchers may need to integrate the study of social action and the study of social form.", "venue": "Administrative science quarterly", "year": 1986, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 2849, "influentialCitationCount": 230, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2040894", "name": "S.

Reforms are thus thought needed to place the \u2018War on Terror' under the rule of law and protect civil liberties. This article attempts to counter that view. Using predictive data mining-a technology at the heart of the US National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance scandal-as an example, it argues that rather than a break with the past, the tactics that the Bush Administration adopted to fight terrorism represent an extension of a particular type of future-oriented power which Foucault (2008) referred to as \"security\" or \"government.\" And while individual civil liberties are no doubt at stake, they are not at stake equally for everyone. Predictive data mining discriminates by design, designating certain groups as threats relative to others. Thus, persons with Middle Eastern and North African backgrounds will disproportionately bear the burden of this surveillance technique and the innumerable mistakes it produces. Finally, the rule of law would seem to offer little to remedy the situation. The War on Drugs, the policing of immigration, and past international disputes with \u2018terrorist regimes' have provided a \"crime jurisprudence\" (Simon 2007) that legitimizes such discrimination.

The premise of this ecological theory is that criminal events result from likely offenders, suitable targets, and the absence of capable guardians against crime converging nonrandomly in time and space. Yet prior research has been unable to employ spatial data, relying instead on individual- and household-level data, to test that basic premise. This analysis supports the premise with spatial data on 323,979 calls to police over all 115,000 addresses and intersections in Minneapolis over 1 year. Relatively few \u201chot spots\u201d produce most calls to Police (50% of calls in 3% of places) and calls reporting predatory crimes (all robberies at 2.2% of places, all rapes at 1.2% of places, and all auto thefts at 2.7% of places), because crime is both rare (only 3.6% of the city could have had a robbery with no repeat addresses) and concentrated, although the magnitude of concentration varies by offense type.

Vindicating Fourth Amendment values today requires more than what the conventional transactional approach has to offer.

Administrative law suggests a way to flesh out the requirement for Fourth Amendment \u201creasonableness\u201d in the exercise of agency discretion, where today\u2019s Fourth Amendment often punts.
