Boolean Functions and Computation Models by Clote and Kranakis. Review by R. Gregory Taylor. This monograph covers an wide range of topics including Boolean functions and Boolean circuit families, propositional proof systems, sequential and parallel models of computation, and function algebras. 3. Linear Optimization and Extensions \u2013 Problems and Solutions by Dimitris Alevas and Manfred Padberg. Review by Carlos A.S. Oliveira. This book is a companion to another book on this topic; however, it stands alone as a good collection of problems and solutions in the field of linear optimization and linear programming. 4. Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms By Ananay Levitin. Reviewed by William Fahle. This is an algorithms book for an undergraduate course that is organized by technique rather than problem.
