An Enquiry Into the Vision of Blockchain-Powered E-Voting Start-Ups", "abstract": "This research sets out to analyze the message promoted by start-up enterprises that apply blockchain technologies for the purpose of e-voting [blockchain-powered e-voting (BPE)], and their perceived effects of this technological solution on democratic outcomes. Employing Norman Fairclough\u2019s critical discourse analysis (CDA), I examined the written output of seven BPE start-ups (Agora, DemocracyEarth, Follow My Vote, Polys, Voatz, Votem, and VoteWatcher), as displayed in their websites. The close attention of CDA to power relations brought out relevant topics of discussion for analysis. Notably, these included: voting as an expression of democracy; technological determinism; individual versus communitarian understandings of democracy; the prominence of neoliberalism and the economic sphere; and technological literacy. Findings from the literature suggest that the assumptions of BPE start-ups about a blockchain-powered democracy diverge from widely accepted understandings of democracy. BPE start-ups envision a democracy determined by positions and institutions of power, by the technologically able, and by economic interests. This research argues that this conception of democracy disempowers voters from any form of decision-making regarding how democracy is run beyond their expression in the form of a vote decided by these established powers. The widespread addresses to existing elites to enable BPE, as well as what is left unsaid about community, collective rights and the not so technologically literate population, imply that BPE developers display concern for one particular expression among the many diverse and heterogeneous understandings of democracy, while disregarding outstanding privacy, security and accountability concerns associated to implementations of the technology for BPE.

The paper's first aim is therefore to develop the MLP's theoretical micro-foundations, which are rooted in Social Construction of Technology, evolutionary economics and neoinstitutional theory. The second aim is to further identify crossovers between these theories. To achieve these goals, the paper analytically reviews the three theories, focusing on: (1) the relevance of each theory for transitions and the MLP, (2) the theory's conceptualisation of agency, (3) criticisms of each theory and subsequent conceptual elaborations (which prepare the ground for potential crossovers between them). Mobilizing insights from the analytical reviews, the paper articulates a multi-dimensional model of agency, which also provides a relational and processual conceptualization of ongoing trajectories in which actors are embedded. Specific conceptual linking points between the three theories are identified, leading to an understanding of socio-technical transitions as evolutionary, interpretive and conflictual processes.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 181, "citationCount": 58, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2654614", "name": "F.

However, community cellular networks face a variety of technical, business, and regulatory challenges that hamper their proliferation.In this thesis, we aim to develop approaches to enable scale within and across community cellular networks. Through a mixed-methods study of more than 80 rural wireless Internet service providers, a related class of network operators, we identify key scaling challenges rural network operators face. We next present two approaches for addressing these challenges in the context of community cellular networks. The first, GSM Whitespaces, demonstrates that rural community cellular networks can safely share spectrum in bands occupied by incumbent mobile network operators, removing a key barrier to independent operation. The second, CCM, shows how community networks and incumbent mobile network operators can cooperate to share resources to extend service. We will explore each of these approaches through practical systems and longitudinal deployments of community cellular networks in Southeast Asia that provide service to thousands of rural people.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 120, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1934763", "name": "Shaddi Hasan"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "40bb19cd141ca36bf95996142e949cc81fbcbf0e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2978079477"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40bb19cd141ca36bf95996142e949cc81fbcbf0e", "title": "\"It knows how to not understand us!\" A study on what the concept of robustness entails in design of conversational agents for preschool children", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1417943554", "name": "Kristine R\u00f8yneland"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "41976ea2db079edf1f80feb6c1ca7531ff475b2e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2929310810", "DOI": "10.24908/SS.V17I1/2.12937"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41976ea2db079edf1f80feb6c1ca7531ff475b2e", "title": "Digital Platforms, Porosity, and Panorama", "abstract": "The concept of porosity, developed by Walter Benjamin and Asja Lacis, is proposed as a useful concept for examining the political, social, and economic impacts of digital platform surveillance on social space.

This article deals with data literacy as a filter for participation in a datafied environment and the role of ordinary people in data processes. Because participation in a datafied world depends of people\u2019s ability to enter the fray, questions about where lines can be drawn to separate experts from non-experts (i.e. ordinary citizens) and whether intervention in the data infrastructure requires a degree of data literacy for effective participation constitute a relevant discussion for the practice and theory of activism as a form of political or civic engagement.

The increasing use of telecare will profoundly change nursing care, in both expected and unexpected ways. The obvious difference is that care professionals will not physically be with patients when care is given at a distance. But there are also more subtle changes, like patients who use the technology on their own terms, and nurses\u2019 improvised solutions to work around hindrances. All of these adjustments turn telecare practices into construction sites, where nurses and patients work to achieve good care. Annemarie van Hout conducted ethnographic research in two field sites: at-home palliative nursing and at-home long-term mental health care. Nurses care at a distance by starting to draw from their daily repertoire, basing their actions on their regular working methods. When nurses encounter hindrances that they have to deal with, they extend their repertoires. This research finds that lessons learned tend to stay within the practice where they are learned. To avoid this pitfall, Annemarie calls for nurses and scholars to work together. When nurses and researchers work together, detecting and articulating changes, sharing and theorizing them, they can tell a new story, a nursing story of telecare, one that can counter the policy stories this thesis begins with.

Nevertheless, with the internet, a global infrastructure has emerged, which, together with mobile and smartphones, has rapidly changed the media landscape. This far-reaching digital connectedness makes it increasingly clear that the main implications of media lie in the extent to which they reach into everyday life. This article puts this reach into historical context, arguing that, in the pre-modern period, geographically extensive media networks only extended to a small elite. With the modern print revolution, media reach became both more extensive and more intensive. Yet it was only in the late nineteenth century that media infrastructures penetrated more widely into everyday life. Apart from a comparative historical perspective, several social science disciplines can be brought to bear in order to understand the ever more globalizing reach of media infrastructures into everyday life, including its limits. To date, the vast bulk of media research is still concentrated on North America and Europe. Recently, however, media research has begun to track broader theoretical debates in the social sciences, and imported debates about globalization from anthropology, sociology, political science, and international relations. These globalizing processes of the media research agenda have been shaped by both political developments and changes in media, including the Cold War, decolonization, the development of the internet and other new media technologies, and the rise of populist leaders.", "venue": "Journal of Global History", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 130, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144194373", "name": "Ralph Schroeder"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["Social historians of technology (Nye, 1990; Fischer, 1992; De la Bruheze and Oldenziel, 2008) have shown that new technologies need to be \u201cdomesticated\u201d and transformed from unfamiliar and possibly threatening things to familiar objects embedded in the routines and practices of everyday life."], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "fe822a77057bbbfc53d9867421d951239b384e85", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2901920041", "DOI": "10.1016/J.TRD.2018.11.012"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe822a77057bbbfc53d9867421d951239b384e85", "title": "Technological diffusion as a process of societal embedding: Lessons from historical automobile transitions for future electric mobility", "abstract": "Technological diffusion can be understood as a broader process of co-construction of technology and its environment. This article conceptualizes this co-construction as a process of societal embedding, in which new technologies find their place in wider societal domains, which include immediate user contexts, cultural meanings, policies, and infrastructures. This perspective helps address three under-developed dimensions in adoption models: (1) diffusion includes more actors than users/adopters, (2) user characteristics and environments are not known in advance, but are articulated during the technological diffusion process, and (3) societal embedding is full of choices and struggles that affect the directionality and thus shape of socio-technical systems. Societal embedding therefore calls importance to the \u201cdemand side\u201d of sustainability transitions. Because electric vehicles have, so far, only achieved limited diffusion globally, we cannot use it to test and illustrate our framework. We therefore use a historical comparative research design, which utilizes the societal embedding framework with two case studies of automobile diffusion in the United States and the Netherlands between the 1880s and 1970s. We subsequently apply the resulting lessons and insights to the future development of electric vehicles, with examples from multiple countries. An important finding is that the successful diffusion of electric vehicles demands a more robust co-construction policy focus that includes tinkering with all aspects of the societal embedding process, and one involving a constellation of agents beyond policymakers and purchasers.", "venue": "Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 180, "citationCount": 43, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "35519897", "name": "Laur Kanger"}, {"authorId": "2654614", "name": "F.

Until the mid\u20101980s, there was minimal serious historiography of radio in general, and early radio in particular. The best known and most widely used source was the first volume in Erik Barnouw\u2019s trilogy on the history of broadcasting, A Tower in Babel (1966) (discussed in Chapter 20 by Gary Edgerton, this volume). Daniel Czitrom also provided a brief account of this era in Media and the American Mind (1982). The only other accounts of radio\u2019s \u201cprehistory,\u201d when the device was known as wireless telegraphy and was used to transmit Morse code messages, were non\u2010academic and often gushing accounts of the invention in books with titles like Old Wires, New Waves (Harlow 1936). Gleason Archer\u2019s History of Radio to 1926, published in 1938, while containing some important history, offered an overly generous account of the role that the Navy, and especially David Sarnoff, president of RCA, played in radio\u2019s early development and was, by turns, untrustworthy or inaccurate. And Rupert Maclaurin provided an early technical history in Invention and Innovation in the Radio Industry (1949). But beginning in 1976, with the publication of Hugh Aitken\u2019s Syntony and Spark (1976), a technical history of the development of wireless, and followed by his prize\u2010 winning The Continuous Wave (1985), a new era of wireless and radio historiography began. My own Inventing American Broadcasting came out in 1987 \u2013 and is discussed in Chapter 21 by Shawn VanCour, this volume \u2013 followed by work, primarily on the broadcast era, by Robert McChesney (1993), Susan Smulyan (1994), Michele Hilmes (1997), and others. By the 1990s, two new fields, radio studies and sound studies, had emerged from this work. The majority of work on radio focused on the post\u20101920s broadcast era. Why was radio\u2019s early history ignored? The \u201cradio boom\u201d of the 1920s seemed so sudden, the diffusion of the device so dramatic, and the entry of voice and music into people\u2019s homes without any connecting wires so miraculous (the word most frequently used at the time), that it eclipsed what came before. By contrast, the exchange of the Morse code between wireless operators could seem like an irrelevant prehistory with not nearly the cultural, political, and economic impact of radio. Yet by the 1970s, historians of technology were challenging the notion of technological revolutions, and also taking on the \u201cEureka\u201d school of invention and its inventor\u2010as\u2010hero narratives that often accompanied such deterministic accounts of technical change.

The paper makes two contributions. First, it aims to broaden the conceptual repertoire by distinguishing two analytical families: adoption models and socio-technical theories of diffusion. We distinguish four adoption models (epidemic, rational choice, socio-psychological, increasing-returns-to-adoption) and three socio-technical models (system building, circulation/replication, societal embedding), and discuss their phenomenological characteristics and causal mechanisms. Second, the paper shows that system diffusion is a multi-dimensional process that is best understood with a modular approach that combines insights from different conceptual models. To demonstrate this second contribution and explore the temporal salience of different models, we apply them to the diffusion of Austrian biomass district heating (BMDH) systems (1979\u20132013).

It begins by criticizing three theories that currently dominate our understanding of digital media and of media generally: network theory, mediatization theory and actor-network theory. It also identifies a gap in current communication theory, namely, that digital media mostly do not fit the divide into mass and interpersonal communication. A further problem is that insufficient attention is given to the difference between political communication and popular culture or everyday life. The article develops an alternative, focusing on four countries that provide a range of relationships between media and society; the U.S., Sweden, India and China. In all four countries, despite their differences, digital media, in contrast to traditional broadcast and interpersonal media, have led to a more differentiated media landscape. Greater complexity in political communication nevertheless runs up against the continuing dominance of elite agenda-setting. In terms of popular culture, all four countries have experienced a proliferation of media offerings and greater tetheredness between people. Hence, new divides are emerging between more active and variegated as against more passive and restricted media uses. The article concludes with implications of digital media for understanding media generally: with new digital media, there is now a need to rethink media theory in terms of fundamental debates about how media transform or preserve the social order.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 24, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144194373", "name": "Ralph Schroeder"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["At this point it will be useful to digress briefly (the topic fits more with chapters 2 and 3, on politics) to look at how big data analytics can be used for political mobilization, which has recently been detailed by Karpf (2015; 2016).", "Instead, as Fischer (1992) has documented, and contrary to these expectations, the telephone first became widespread when ordinary people wanted to keep each other company over distances.", "As Karpf (2016) argues:\u00a0\u2018In a world with digital media, but less analytics, this election drama would have unfolded differently . . . journalists and their editors would have been less attuned to the immediate feedback of Trump\u2019s daily ratings effects, and this would have led them to spread their coverage more evenly (as they always have in the past).", "(2015; 2016) asked Facebook users about how Facebook uses data to shape the information they see."], "isInfluential": true, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "896c99d3ca114e07d2e18c0e30470ba1b0406505", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2904105116", "DOI": "10.14324/111.9781787351226"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/896c99d3ca114e07d2e18c0e30470ba1b0406505", "title": "Social Theory After the Internet: Media, Technology, and Globalization", "abstract": "Media, Technology and Globalization Ralph Schroeder The internet has fundamentally transformed society in the past 25 years, yet existing theories of mass or interpersonal communication do not work well in understanding a digital world.

However, while they are becoming more omnipresent in human life, there is increasing concern that they are often used at inappropriate times during social interactions, and that people often ignore others in favour of their phones. In this thesis, we explore the phenomenon of \"phubbing\" - the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by concentrating on one's mobile phone. In a series of ten empirical studies, we demonstrate that Internet addiction, fear of missing out, and self-control predict smartphone addiction, which in turn predicts the extent to which people phub. This path also predicts the extent to which people feel that phubbing is normative, both via (a) the extent to which people are phubbed themselves, and (b) independently. Phubbing also significantly dampens perceived communication quality and relationship satisfaction in dyadic conversation. These effects are mediated by reduced feelings of belonging and both positive and negative affect. In addition, the results indicate that the degree to which someone is affected by phubbing is not determined by the relationship status between phubber and phubbee. We also develop and validate the Generic Scale of Phubbing (GSP) to assess phubbing behaviour, and the Generic Scale of Being Phubbed (GSBP) to assess the experience of being phubbed. Both scales reveal good psychometric properties.

Similarly, despite early fantasies of cross-cultural communication, the telephone facilitated socially insular conversation as it became systematized.

To reach these local customers, utility managers required their employees to peddle stock directly to their friends, family, and customers.

The study was undertaken as an intervention, designed to close the digital divide among low income households in Nairobi by introducing internet access using the domestication framework. Background Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have the potential to help reduce social inequality and have been hailed as critical to the achievement of the Sustainable Development goals (SDGs). Skills in use of ICTs have also become a prerequisite for almost all forms of employment and in accessing government services, hence, the need for digital inclusion for all. Methodology In this research study, I employed a mixed methods approach to investigate the problem. This was achieved through a preliminary survey to collect data on the existence of urban digital divide in Nairobi and a contextual analysis of the internet domestication process among the eighteen selected case studies. Contribution While there have been many studies on digital divide between Africa and the rest of the world, within the African continent, among genders and between rural and urban areas at national levels, there are few studies exploring urban digital divide and especially among the marginalized communities living in the low-income urban areas. Findings Successful domestication of internet and related technologies was achieved among the selected households, and the households appreciated the benefits of having and using the internet for the first time. A number of factors that impede use of internet among the marginalized communities in Nairobi were also identified. Recommendations for Practitioners In the study, I found that use of differentiated costs internet services targeting specific demographic groups is possible and that use of such a service could help the marginalized urban communities\u2019 access the internet. Therefore, ISPs should offer special internet access packages for the low-income households. Closing the Digital Divide in Low-Income Urban Communities 118 Recommendation for Researchers In this research study, I found that the urban digital divide in Nairobi is an indication of social economic development problems. Therefore, researchers should carryout studies involving multipronged strategies to address the growing digital divide among the marginalized urban communities. Impact on Society The absence of an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) inclusion policy is a huge setback to the achievement of the SDGs in Kenya. Digital inclusion policies prioritizing digital literacy training, universal internet access and to elucidate the social-economic benefits of internet access for all Kenyans should be developed.

The legitimacy problem complicates new ventures\u2019 access to external resources. Overcoming these liabilities means gaining legitimacy in the eyes of significant audiences (Stinchcombe, 1965; Singh, Tucker & House, 1986). To date, the research on new ventures\u2019 legitimation has mainly taken one of the following two perspectives: the neo-institutional perspective, in which scholars view new ventures legitimation as a product of conformity with institutional norms and standards, and the strategic perspective, in which scholars focus on new ventures\u2019 proactive symbolic actions aimed at manipulating audiences\u2019 perceptions. Although existing studies of liabilities of newness and smallness rest on the assumption that new ventures\u2019 lack of legitimacy is inter-subjective, the social-constructionist aspect of this phenomenon has not been sufficiently investigated. For instance, extant studies have overlooked entrepreneurs\u2019 subjective experiences ensuing from their ventures\u2019 lack of legitimacy. \n \nEmerging literature on the sensemaking of entrepreneurial failures partly fills this knowledge gap. These studies have examined how entrepreneurs cognitively process and narratively construct their ventures\u2019 failures (e. g. Cardon et al, 2011; Mantere et al, 2013). However, these studies focus on ultimate failures, rather than failed attempts to acquire external resources. Continued inability to acquire key resources, being a direct premise of entrepreneurial failures, has not been studied as a subject of sensemaking. \n \nTherefore, this study seeks to understand how entrepreneurs make sense of and narratively construct experienced hardship of resource acquisition at the early years of their ventures\u2019 existence. Furthermore, although scholars acknowledge that public perception influences the way entrepreneurs\u2019 make sense of their ventures\u2019 failures (e. g. Cardon et al, 2011), extant literature failed to explain what constitutes public perception of entrepreneurial failures. Therefore, this study also seeks to understand how entrepreneurs\u2019 narrative construction of failures and hardship affects public perception. \n \nTo fulfil the research objectives, this study is based on a synthesis of the literatures on new ventures legitimation, entrepreneurial failures and social movements (e. g. Benford & Snow, 2000). Social movement approach provides suitable theoretical and methodological framework for the research endeavour. Social movement studies explore how collective discontent is made sense of, grievances are articulated and framed as injustice by social actors in pursuit of social change (Turner, 1995). \n \nIn this study, narratives of entrepreneurs whose ventures\u2019 development is hampered by inability to access external resources are examined. The empirical investigation is focused on the new ventures\u2019 attempts to establish collaborative technology partnerships with incumbents. Frame analysis (Goffman, 1974; Creed et al, 2002a) is adapted to critically examine entrepreneurs\u2019 narratives collected through very in-depth interviews. The data set comprised narrative interviews with 35 entrepreneurs and 16 top managers of private and public organizations in France. \n \nThe findings of this study suggest that failed attempts to establish technology partnerships with incumbents trigger entrepreneurs\u2019 sensemaking of their own experiences and also broader reinterpretation of technology partnership as a patterned social interaction. It was found that the entrepreneurs whose ventures\u2019 development is hampered by inability to access incumbents\u2019 resources are likely to frame their hardship as injustice rather than simple misfortune or mistake. The findings also indicate that injustice frame plays twofold role in the entrepreneurial dynamics. Besides being an interpretive and blame externalizing mental model, injustice frame also plays a sensegiving role. It is demonstrated that when framing their hardship as injustice, entrepreneurs employ contextually embedded discourse to construct collective identities of new ventures and incumbents that ascribe role expectations to resource-holding incumbents. Furthermore, relevance to experience and cultural resonance of the injustice frame determines its appropriation by other actors and, therefore, its impact on the public discourse.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 293, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48190546", "name": "V.

Furthermore, while personal devices have been designed to support awareness for the individual user (e.g., notifications), little is known about how to support shared awareness in acceptability in social settings such as meals. In order to understand attitudes about mobile phone use during shared mealtimes, we conducted an online survey with 1,163 English-speaking participants. We find that attitudes about mobile phone use at meals differ depending on the particular phone activity and on who at the meal is engaged in that activity, children versus adults.

All consumers in the market are subscribed to one of two networks, whereby, initially, clusters of subscribers to network B exist. A priori, consumers lack information on the market shares of both network and, hence, have to engage in costly fixed-sample search. With respect to the extent of search costs, I distinguish between three types of consumers: (1) fully informed consumers (FICs) have non-positive search costs and, accordingly, are always perfectly informed about networks' market shares; (2) partly informed consumers (PICs) have moderate search costs, which allow them to observe market shares within a circular sensing field; and (3) locally informed consumers (LICs) have high search costs and, hence, only observe market shares among their immediate eight neighbours. Irrespective of their type, consumers maximize their expected utility by subscribing to the network offering the lowest expected cost for a call to a random consumer. The results of a systematic variation of the key parameters of the model show that the larger network's probability to increase its market share or to corner the market is negatively affected by the fraction of PICs and LICs, whereas it is positively affected by PICs's sensing radius, the larger network's initial market share, and the number of clusters. The introduction of calling clubs reveals that the probability of calling a friend inflicts a negative effect while the size of the calling clubs has a positive effect.

Accompanying this phenomenon is an apparent growing level of uncertainty about the trustfulness of strangers. Hence the study of generalized social trust has become essential in terms of the need to understand and cope with the serious impacts of globalization, especially as expressed through interpersonal communication.This is especially the case for contemporary globalized \"megacities,\" where great numbers of people flow both into and out of countries, such as newcomers coming to live in a new country or visitors conducting business or touring for leisure. While these people would certainly like to have the expectation that they will be safe, events in recent decades make that expectation less tenable. That is, for the most part, the security and interpersonal trustworthiness of life in the village has been supplanted by something much different, where people move about and are now an amalgam from a variety of cultures and social systems. The former social structure, the village (or smaller city), involves particularized (personal) trust, whereas the latter, i.e. mega-scale society, involves generalized trust as the personal element fades in the face of industrialization and globalization.Trust, as addressed by sociologists such as Ferdinand Tonnies, Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim, and Talcott Parsons, was deemed essential to social relationships. Simmel (1950, p. 326) stated that \"trust is one of the most important synthetic forces in the society.\" Today, many scholars are taking yet another closer look at trust. For instance, Blau (1964, p. 99) stated that trust is \"essential for stable social relationships.\" Many other scholars emphasize that trust plays a critical role in interpersonal and group relationships (e.g., Golembiewski and McConkie 1975; Lewis and Weigart 1985; Zucker 1986). Our economic system is in many ways entirely dependent upon trust because if there were no trust there could be no economic transactions (cf. Hirsch 1978). Thus trust has profound implications for interpersonal and social cooperation. Indeed, without trust, societies really could not exist (Bok 1978, p. 26). Nikolas Luhmann comes to mind as perhaps one of the most important scholars to have considered the role of trust in social systems, or in sociology for that matter. To Luhmann (1979, p. 8) trust \"reduces [social system] complexity.\" Unquestionably, social systems are becoming increasingly complex and confounded, and for Luhmann this means that trust plays an ever-increasingly critical role.Today, it has been observed that trust levels are declining among many industrialized nations (e.g., Dalton 2004; Hardin 2006; Putnam 1993), thus calling for greater attention and concern. Social isolation brought about by modernization is frequently cited as one of many reasons to reexamine social trust. Other reasons include dramatic changes in demographics, politics, cultures, institutional structures and all that these influence.As a consequence of trust's ostensibly unique position, there is often a temptation to leave it undefined. Of course, there is a considerable degree of complexity, and controversy, when it comes to defining trust. Should one merely attempt to define trust, or should one focus on its contextual implications and roles? Unquestionably, there has been a distinct lack of empirical studies of trust and its determinants (cf. Butler 1991). For instance, is trust perceptual or attitudinal at the individual level, or is it an essential component of the social structure itself? If the latter is true, then social trust must be looked upon with reference to social norms and expectations. Hence, trust must then be \"understood sociologically, just as social institutions, social stratification, and social change must be\" (Wuthnow 2004, pp. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 17, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145901153", "name": "M.

This paper advances our understanding of microcoordination via the use of messaging apps. Specifically, it provides insights into the dual roles of instrumental and expressive interaction integral to the functioning of these messaging groups, ambient-mediated sociation in the form of readily available communication partners in groups, and the emergence of meme-based coordination.

One answer is that computers are distinctive in their direct and systematic relationship to language. Another is that the Internet, through its layered architecture, is highly appropriable. Even so, the Internet does not cause a revolution or define a wholly separate \"cyber\" sphere. Instead, due to its distinctive qualities, it participates in somewhat distinctive ways in the ongoing political life of institutions. When I was going to graduate school at MIT, most of the professors around me were embarrassed to be called computer scientists. Their complaint was this: why should there be a separate field of computer science, any more than there is a separate field of refrigerator science? In their view, computers were just complex physical artifacts like any others. Following Simon (1969), they argued that design principles such as modularity are not specific to software, but are properties of the universe in general. The structures that evolve are modular because modular structures are more stable than others. Computers were simply a special case of these universal laws. This perspective on computer science differs from the view in most textbooks. In the textbooks, a computer is a device that can compute any function that any particular Turing machine can compute. The professors at MIT would have none of this. Of course the mathematics of computability was interesting, but it reflected only one corner of a much larger space of inquiry. What they found most interesting was not the mapping from single inputs to single outputs but the relationship between the structure of a computational device and the organization of the computational process that arose when the device was set running. The physical realization of computational processes was, however, only half the story. The other half lay in the analysis of problem domains. This is a profound aspect of computer work -and all engineering work -that is almost invisible to outsiders. Computers are general-purpose machines in that they can be applied to problems in any sphere. A system designer might work on an accounting application in the morning and an astronomical simulation in the afternoon. As the problems in these domains are translated into computational terms, certain patterns recur, and engineers abstract these patterns into layers of settled technique. Here is an example. I once consulted with a company that wanted to automate the design of some complex mechanical artifacts. The designer of these artifacts might have to make several dozen design decisions. I spent several weeks sitting with an engineer and marching through a stack of manuals for the design of this category of artifacts. We needed the answer to a critical question: in working forward from requirements to design, does the designer ever need to backtrack? Is it ever necessary to make a design decision that might have to be retracted later? If backtracking was required, the company's task would become much harder. After working several cases by hand, it became clear that backtracking was not only necessary but ubiquitious, and that the company needed to hire someone who could build a general-purpose architecture for the backtracking of parameterized constraints. Backtracking is an example of a structure that recurs frequently in the analysis of problem domains. The resulting analogy among domains can be pursued, and might be illuminating all around. For the professors at MIT, then, engineering consists of a dialectical engagement between two activities: analyzing the ontology of a domain and realizing that domain's decision-making processes in the physical world. (\"Realize\" here means \"make physically real\" rather than \"mentally understand\".) Ideas about computational structure exist for the purpose of translating back and forth between these two aspects of the engineer's work. This is a profound conception of engineering. And nothing about it is specific to computers. This story is appealing because it dissolves the concept of the computer, which normally connotes a sharp 02/01/2008 20:07 Internet Research: For and Against Page 2 of 8 http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/research.html break with the past, into the great historical tradition of engineering design. It is certainly an improvement on the standard story based on computability theory. Still, I believe that both stories overlook one area in which design is different for computers than for anything else. That area pertains to language. Computers, whatever their other virtues, at least give people something to talk about. Your friends in China may not be having the same weather, but they are having the same virus outbreaks. Computers not only transcend geographical boundaries; they also bridge disciplines. Physicists and literary critics may not be able to discuss their research, but they can discuss their computers. Soldiers and media artists struggle with the same software. This kind of universality arises precisely from the analytical phase of the design process. Computers, in this sense, provide a \"trading zone\" (Galison 1997) for discussions across different disciplinary languages. Computers are a shared layer in a wide variety of activities, and many activities have been reconstructed on top of the platform that computer standards provide. In these ways and more, computers are densely bound up with language (Hirschheim, Klein, and Lyytinen 1996; Swanson and Ramiller 1997; Theoharakis and Wong 2002; Weill and Broadbent 1998). Saying this, however, does not identify what is distinctive about computers. The answer is: computers are distinctive in their relation to discourse. Discourses about the world -that is, about people and their lives, the natural environment, business processes, social relationships, and so on -are inscribed into the workings of computers. It does not follow, of course, that computers then turn around and reinscribe those discourses into the activities of the people who use them. Every social setting takes hold of its computers in its own distinctive way (Orlikowski 2000). But neither is a computer a blank slate. Every system affords a certain range of interpretations, and that range is determined by the discourses that have been inscribed into it. To understand what is distinctive about the inscription of discourses into computers, as opposed to their inscription into other sorts of artifacts, it helps to distinguish among three progressively more specific meanings of the idea of inscription. (1) Shaping. Sociologists refer to the \"social shaping of technology\" (Dierkes and Hoffman 1992, MacKenzie and Wajcman 1985, Wiebe and Bijker 1992). Newly invented technologies typically exist in competing variants, but that political conflicts and other social processes eventually settle on particular designs. One prototype of social shaping is \"how the refrigerator got its hum\" (Cowan 1985): early refrigerators came in both electric and gas varieties, but the electric variety won the politics of infrastructure and regulation. Social shaping is also found in the styling of artifacts, for example tailfins on cars, and elsewhere. Social shaping analyses can be given for every kind of technology, and while language is certainly part of the process, the concept of social shaping does not turn on any specific features of language. (2) Roles. One type of social shaping is found in the presuppositions that a technology can make about the people who use it. Akrich (1992a, 1992b) gives examples of both successes and failures that turned on the designers' understandings of users. A company created a device consisting of a solar cell, a battery, and a lamp, intended for use in countries with underdeveloped infrastructures. Rather than study the web of relationships in which those people lived, though, the company sought to make its device foolproof, for example by making it hard to take apart and by employing components that were not available on the local market. When ordinary problems arose, such as the short wire between the battery and the lamp, the users were unable to adapt it. By contrast, a videocassette player embodied elaborate ideas about the user, for example as a person subject to copyright laws, that its very design was largely successful in enforcing. In each case, the designer, through a narrative that was implicit or explicit in the design process, tried to enlist the user into a certain social role. And language is geared to the construction of narratives about roles and relationships. (See also Barley (1990), Feenberg (1991: 80-82), Latour (1996), Lea and Giordano (1997), Mackay, Carne, and BeynonDavies 2000, Sharrock and Button (1997), and Woolgar (1991).) Even so, nothing here is specific to computers either. (3) Grammar. Where computers are really distinctive is in their relationship to grammar. Systems analysis does not exactly analyze a domain, as the professors at MIT would have it. Rather, it analyzes a discourse for talking about a domain. (Or perhaps a domain must be understood as a discourse bound up with the objects it describes.) To be sure, much of the skill of systems analysis consists in assimilating this discourse to known techniques for realizing a decision-making process in the physical world (Suchman and Trigg 1993). But the substance of the work is symbolic. Computer people are ontologists, and their work consists of stretching whatever discourse they find upon the ontological grid that is provided by their particular design methodology, whether entity-relationship data models (Simsion 2001), object-oriented programming (Booch 1996), or the language-action perspective (Winograd and Flores 1986). In each case, the systems analyst performs a profound transformation upon the domain discourse. The discourse is taken apart down to its most primitive el", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 75, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "35126179", "name": "P.

This article investigates the origins of these ideas, finding that Richard T. Ely\u2014a celebrated American economist of the late nineteenth century\u2014embedded in the term \u201cnatural monopoly\u201d a narrative of technological determinism. By arguing that certain services had monopolizing tendencies hardwired into them, Ely argued for their regulation. Ely\u2019s theory of natural monopoly formed the basis of Wisconsin\u2019s 1907 public utilities law, which served as a model for many other states\u2019 regulatory policies. The modern notion of public utility thus carries with it the technological determinism of Ely\u2019s natural monopoly idea. By tracing the lineage of these two terms, this article recaptures the influence that activists and progressive politicians exercised over the formation of large technological systems during the Second Industrial Revolution.", "venue": "Technology and culture", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "15447477", "name": "Adam Plaiss"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "ed4efc1e8cf30c45d4cf5f0d4bdc414cfbc41885", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2551568660", "DOI": "10.1353/tech.2016.0110", "PubMed": "28569693"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed4efc1e8cf30c45d4cf5f0d4bdc414cfbc41885", "title": "Proximal Design: Users as Designers of Mobility in the Russian North", "abstract": "By examining mobility in remote Arctic areas, we analyze how challenging environmental conditions, while affecting technology performance, evoke people\u2019s creativity and efforts as technology users.

Our main argument is that continuous tuning, modification, and redesign of technology carried out by immediate users in situ make it possible for humans and machines to function in extreme settings and that this can lead also to emergence of enduring design principles.

Great care is required to avoid amalgams that could introduce an artifi cial continuity that has no evidentiary basis between human computers, keypunch operators or today\u2019s women labourers in computing (with all the diversity within the milieus of industry, public and private research, education, etc.). Therefore, creating a dialogue that includes diverse ICTs, diverse contexts and various European countries may make this all the more diffi cult.
