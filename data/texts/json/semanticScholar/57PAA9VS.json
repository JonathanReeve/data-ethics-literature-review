There is a concern that something is wrong with these violent games, but, since the violence is virtual rather than real, it is difficult to specify the nature of the wrongness. Since there is no proven causal connection between video-game violence and real violence, philosophical analysis can be particularly helpful in locating potential sources of wrongness in ultra-violent video games. To this end, this paper analyzes video game violence through the lens of utilitarian, Kantian, and post-modern perspectives. Through these analyses, several explanations of the wrongness in violent video games emerge.", "venue": "Ethics and Information Technology", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 7, "citationCount": 53, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144331029", "name": "David Waddington"}]}
