Deeply imbedded in American minds and institutions, this white racial frame has for centuries functioned as a broad worldview, one essential to the routine legitimation, scripting, and maintenance of systemic racism in the United States. Here Feagin examines how and why this white racial frame emerged in North America, how and why it has evolved socially over time, which racial groups are framed within it, how it has operated in the past and in the present for both white Americans and Americans of color, and how the latter have long responded with strategies of resistance that include enduring counter-frames. In this new edition, Feagin has included much new interview material and other data from recent research studies on framing issues related to white, black, Latino, and Asian Americans, and on society generally. The book also includes a new discussion of the impact of the white frame on popular culture, including on movies, video games, and television programs as well as a discussion of the white racial frame's significant impacts on public policymaking, immigration, the environment, health care, and crime and imprisonment issues.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 589, "influentialCitationCount": 69, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "93292986", "name": "J.

Science proceeds within legal, philosophical, and cultural bounds that are set by the society around it and that impose limits on the pace and conduct of medical research. The doctrine of informed consent for clinical research has been a cornerstone of this process since the end of the Second World War. Our present informed consent process, however, has proved difficult to apply to populations with diminished cognitive capacity, such as children, the retarded, the mentally ill, and those with dementia. As medical research interests turn to these special populations, conflicts arise concerning the application of the traditional doctrine of informed consent. We are probably in the midst of a change with regard to the consent process for clinical research in these special populations. A symposium of nationally recognized experts was convened to address the issue of informed consent in research involving people with Alzheimer disease (AD) on November 1, 2001, in Lubbock, Texas. The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Carillon Senior Living Campus Research and Education Center, and by the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and was supported by the Helen Jones Foundation and Janssen Pharmaceutica. The distinguished faculty of the symposium included an ethicist, an attorney, two clinical investigators in the fields of aging and AD, a sociologist, and a neuropsychiatrist. The texts of the primary presentations follow in this Supplement. The presenters agreed that we have a collective societal obligation to improve our scientific understanding and treatment of AD. The demographics, economics, and illness burdens of this disorder will create a therapeutic imperative for the twenty-first century, at least in the developed countries. There was also general agreement at the symposium that our present informed consent rules, statutes, and beliefs are an impediment to the conduct of research carrying moderate to high risk in people with AD. Our current consent procedures grew out of reactions to the social cataclysms of the middle years of the twentieth century, especially from examples of enforced experimentation that came to light during the Nuremburg trials. The philosophical substrate of this informed consent process rests on the notion of the autonomous, reasonable individual who gives consent based on an informed cognitive evaluation and judgment. There is often an implied or stated benefit to the individual participant in clinical research, which the participant presumably balances against the risks of the project. This philosophical foundation is a poor fit to the growing population of cognitively impaired individuals, the future cohorts of whom will have the most to gain from such medical research. Moreover, such a schema of the consent process may not, in fact, match some of the realities of the interchange between investigator and participant. Drs. Stephen Post and Cornelia Beck presented discussions of the current situation with regard to research ethics in clinical studies involving cognitively impaired older people. Our present autonomy-based ethics in consent are awkward to apply to clinical research for the cognitively impaired. These difficulties apply both to the consenting process of participation and to the dissenting dimension of participation, when it is presumed that an autonomous subject may decide to withdraw from any ongoing project. In medical research, unlike medical care, the beneficiary is most likely to be some present or future element of society, as opposed to the actual research participant. This displacement of potential benefit from the participant to society in clinical research creates an ethical problem for a consent process founded substantially on the notion of individual autonomy. Several solutions have been attempted, but we are fully comfortable with none. One approach has been for investigators to emphasize potential direct benefits that might accrue to research subjects during the conduct of research. The imputation of direct benefit to the research subject by investigators analogizes the consent process in research to the consent process in health care, with which we are all more familiar. Benefits are often emphasized by investigators Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders Vol. 17, Suppl. 1, pp. S1\u2013S2 \u00a9 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc., Philadelphia", "venue": "Neurology", "year": 1988, "referenceCount": 2, "citationCount": 6486, "influentialCitationCount": 638, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1702954", "name": "R.

The contributors address this topic--still difficult to engage honestly, clearly, empathetically, and with informed understanding in twenty-first century America--with the goal of pushing consideration of a vexing but important subject from margin to center. Learning Race and Ethnicity explores the intersection of race and ethnicity with post 9/11 politics, online hate-speech practices, and digital youth and media cultures. It examines universal access and the racial and ethnic digital divide from the perspective of digital media learning and youth. The chapters treat such subjects as racial identity in the computer-mediated public sphere, minority technology innovators, new methods of music distribution, digital artist Judy Baca's work with youth, Native American digital media literacy, and minority youth technology access and the pervasiveness of online health information.

This Article does not argue for a radical change of the normative standards under which our copyright law currently operates, nor does it urge that the narrative of the author should be emphasized over and above the other forces that have shaped our copyright law.

This paper engages the topic through three different venues: the current discourse on race and technology (the digital divide), the experiences of black women who work in technology, and the figuration of race and gender on the Web. The overarching question that links these three different sections is whether black women can find a \u201croom of their own,\u201d as it were, in cyberspace. As Lisa Nakamura argues in Cybertypes: Race, Ethnicity, and Identity on the Internet, the myth of cyberspace as a \u201craceless, genderless, and sexuality-free\u201d space is one that thrives in a variety of chat room and other on-line forums. Nakamura argues that \u201crace is constructed as a matter of aesthetics, or finding the color that you like, rather than as a matter of ethnic identity or shared cultural referents. The fantasy of skin color divorced from politics, oppression or racism seems to also celebrate it as infinitely changeable, customizable; as entirely elective as well as political\u201d (53).1 All of these identities, of course, exist in and are constantly reconstructed through language, a medium that, even in the age of Java, still rules as the central means of signification on the Web.

Anderson explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialisation of religious faiths, the decline of antique kingship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of vernacular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was modularly adopted by popular movements in Europe, by the imperialist powers, and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa.

Less work has gone into developing analytic categories that allow us to capture the complex imbrications of technology and society. This article addresses two particular aspects of this challenge through two organizing efforts. First, understanding the place of these new technologies from a sociological perspective requires avoiding a purely technological interpretation and recognizing the embeddedness and the variable outcomes of these technologies for different social orders. These technologies can indeed be constitutive of new social dynamics, but they can also be derivative or merely reproduce older conditions. Second, such an effort will, in turn, call for categories that capture what are now often conceived of as contradictory, or mutually exclusive, attributes.

It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the \"new West.\" Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, The Devil in Silicon Valley shows how San Jose, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics. This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as Cesar Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor. This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story.

These new movements seemed diffuse and unstructured, yet at the same time, they forged unlikely coalitions of labor, environmentalists, feminists, peace, and global social justice activists collectively critical of the adversities of neoliberal globalization and its associated militarism. Moreover, the rapid emergence and worldwide proliferation of these movements, organized and coordinated through the Internet, raised a number of questions that require rethinking social movement theory.

The author interprets how the changing social and political movements of the times have influenced the production and meaning of Trek texts and the ways in which the ongoing series negotiated and reflected these turbulent histories.

In examining the blog's structure, posts, and comments, I applied Omi and Winant's racial formation theory to the cultural representations and structural phenomena articulated with respect to themes of race, racial interactions, media, and geography.

Accordingly, this paper examines interpretations of race in The Wire (a critically-acclaimed minority-led television show), the New York Times news website, the Freakonomics blog, and the Web-enabled audience of the three elements.

With essays devoted to theories of racial domination, comparative global racisms, trans-national white identity, and post-apartheid South Africa, the geographical reach of the volume is significant and broad. Dalton Conley writes on 'How I Learned to Be White'. Alan Berube discusses the intersection of gay identity and whiteness, and Mab Segrest describes the terrible spiritual price white people pay for living in a system of white supremacy. Other pieces examine the utility of whiteness as a critical term for social analysis, contextualise different attempts at antiracist activism, and explore how whiteness affects those seen as racially privileged. In a razor sharp introduction, the editors not only raise provocative questions about the intellectual, social, and political goals of those interested in the study of whiteness but hone in on several of the topic's major recurrent themes: the visibility (or lack thereof) of whiteness; the 'emptiness' of whiteness as a category of identification; and, conceptions of whiteness as a structural privilege, a harbinger of violence, or an institutionalisation of European imperialism.

Our results suggest that nationalism, religion and definitions of responsible citizenship are interwoven with race to create a sense of collective identity for these groups, their members and potential recruits. Moreover, interpretative frameworks that simultaneously identify threatening social issues and provide corresponding recommendations for social action are employed. Importantly, and relative to prior work, results show how the interpretation of problems, their alleged causes and the call to action are systematically linked.

Specifically, we survey how (1) most work on racial attitudes creates a mythical view on Whites\u2019 racial attitudes, (2) the various demographic indices used to asses post-civil rights\u2019 racial matters miss how race affects minorities today, (3) perspectives on the culture of minorities are based on ethnocentric perspectives that tend to hide the centrality of racially based networks, and (4) the way most sociologists report their results distorts the significance of racial stratification.

Durham: Duke University Press, 2003. Tara McPherson begins Reconstructing Dixie with this observation: \"The South is as much a fiction, a story we tell and are told, as it is fixed geographic space below the Mason-Dixon line\" (1). This huge, grandly conceived book is an investigation of the multiple stones told and retold about the South using the social constructs of nostalgia, gender, and race. It is fitting, then, that McPherson begins her narrative with a short autobiographical story that locates her as a southern expatriate living in Los Angeles. With this statement of self-disclosure, the author breaks out of the hermetic space of scholarly writing to acknowledge that there is no such thing as the \"objective scholar.\" McPherson's story establishes her right to deconstruct and reconstruct the South as an insider who has both the authority to tell a southern story, and is deeply implicated in it. Thus, while McPherson's book is a complex and multilayered study of the many narratives of the South, it is written from within and is by perforce \"her\" story. In order to demonstrate how the grand narrative of the mythic South can be both fixed and unfixed, McPherson avoids the \"standard\" narratives of the South (such as William Faulkner) to introduce a refreshingly eclectic range of stories taken from fiction, film, television, journalism, the tourist industry, the Internet, autobiography, and the field of Southern studies. She examines a number of fixed stories in which the \"Old South\" and the \"New South\" are narrated as stones of nostalgia, guilt, and race, in which flat unidimensional characters such as the southern belle, the southern lady, the southern gentleman, and even the \"happy slave\" are presented as immutable. She explores a number of other stories in which the characters are more ambivalent, unfixed, mutable, and complex. McPherson's goal is to display the concept of \"lenticular vision\" (McPherson's term for a bifurcated vision in which two separate images are superimposed but can only be perceived separately and in opposition), and then to complicate and dislodge these oppositional perceptions by suggesting that nostalgia, gender, and race must be perceived as integral parts of a shared continuum of knowledge and belief. In chapter one, McPherson explores the female narrative of the Old South through the constructs of the southern belle or southern lady, and the southern black female as her inverse. In her analysis of Margaret MitchelPs Gone with the Wind and its doubly fictional sequel, Scarlett, McPherson introduces Scarlett O'Hara as the archetypal southern belle, a shapely coquette, whose highly polished beauty and femininity, genteel behavior, and gracious hospitality are set in the center (or on the porch) of a grand plantation house, which in its turn is embedded in the mythic Southern land. The southern lady is also characterized as both gracious and fragile, but she is also, like Scarlett, tough and enduring (to rule over plantations when the men are away), and one with the land (to which Scarlett inevitably returns for succor). Mitchell's plantation is a female and feminized world in which southern gentlemen (the abstracted protectors of white women) are often physically and metaphorically absent. The ties of the southern belle and lady to the plantation (home) and land (place) are thus rendered \"natural,\" and by extension, real. Mitchell's (and McPherson's) description of Mammy is the inverse of Scarlett, her black opposite. In comparison to Scarlett's shapely form and kittenish character, Mammy's body is described as huge, old, shapeless, and unsexed, ruined by hard physical labor. She is caricatured as a \"happy slave\" whose loyalty to and protection of her mistress is absolute and therefore also \"natural.\" In Scarlett, Mammy (and race) are expunged by Mammy's death. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 82, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "113352740", "name": "Joy Sperling"}]}}, {"intents": ["result"], "contexts": ["(Kendall, 2000: 271\u2013272)\nWilliams et al.

She shows how postmodern concepts in art, architecture, and ethics are related to concrete topics much closer to home, for example AI research (Minsky's \"Society of Mind\") and even MUDs (exemplified by students with X-window terminals who are doing homework in one window and simultaneously playing out several different roles in the same MUD in other windows). Those of you who have (like me) been turned off by the shallow, pretentious, meaningless paintings and sculptures that litter our museums of modern art may have a different perspective after hearing what Turkle has to say. \nThis is a psychoanalytical book, not a technical one. However, software developers and engineers will find it highly accessible because of the depth of the author's technical understanding and credibility.

The struggle for national independence coincided with the rise of the Internet and the Eritrean diaspora has been actively involved in the new state. Eritreans abroad use the Internet as a transnational public sphere where they produce and debate narratives of history, culture, democracy and identity. Through the web the diaspora has mobilized demonstrators, amassed funds for war, debated the formulation of the constitution, and influenced the government of Eritrea. Through their web postings, 'Internet intellectuals' interpret national crises, rearticulate values and construct community. Thus, the Internet is not simply about information but is also an emotion-laden and creative space. More than simply refugees or struggling workers, diasporas online may invent new forms of citizenship, community and political practices. Identity is not a constant and is something that is renegotiated on (a) regular basis, be it at the individual or at the national level. This is especially prob- lematic for those of us living in the diaspora, we deal with so many identities and our existence is literally schizophrenic. We want to remain actively interested in the affairs of the homeland, at the same time we live in countries that (are) careless about our internal struggles and hence our miserable dependence on mediums like Dehai for a sense of belonging and for the illusion of home that it creates. I would even venture to say that the various cyber shoutings and negative exchanges we are accustomed to in Dehai are a necessary and unavoidable aspects of being a part of such a community.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 218, "influentialCitationCount": 15, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144129083", "name": "V.

I contend that the central problem of the various approaches to the study of racial phenomena is their lack of a structural theory of racism. I review traditional approaches and alternative approaches to the study of racism, and discuss their limitations. Following the leads suggested by some of the alternative frameworks, I advance a structural theory of racism based on the notion of racialized social systems. \"The habit of considering racism as a mental quirk, as a psychological flaw, must be abandoned.\" -Frantz Fanon (1967:77) he area of race and ethnic studies lacks a _ sound theoretical apparatus. To complicate matters, many analysts of racial matters have abandoned the serious theorization and reconceptualization of their central topic: racism. Too many social analysts researching racism assume that the phenomenon is selfevident, and therefore either do not provide a definition or provide an elementary definition (Schuman, Steeh, and Bobo 1985; Sniderman and Piazza 1993). Nevertheless, whether implicitly or explicitly, most analysts regard racism as a purely ideological phenomenon.", "venue": "", "year": 1997, "referenceCount": 197, "citationCount": 1489, "influentialCitationCount": 89, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1416761454", "name": "E.
