The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people\u2019s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird\u2019s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.\n \n", "venue": "Internet of Things", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 584, "citationCount": 55, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1492046485", "name": "Jean-Paul A.

While innovations were incremental in character, a bottom-up process of learning and experimentation by field commanders was critical to generating most of these innovations.

Case studies and forensic data relating to the response of conventional blast damaged buildings have been investigated. Based on the conclusions drawn from this investigation a simple ranking system has been presented that identifies the level of confidence offered by various forms of direct and indirect robust design. Catenary action has been shown to be a fundamental mechanism of emergency load redistribution for which research has been relatively limited, particularly in relation to RC frame constructions. An experimental investigation has been carried out; this involved the testing to failure of a series of half scale RC strip specimens, detailed to conventional detailing practices, to investigate the large displacement behaviour and ultimate collapse resistance of laterally restrained RC floor components following the loss of intermediate column support. The results showed characteristic compressive and tensile membrane responses. However, tensile membrane action was found to provide the largest reserve of strength and to offer the highest potential as a means of emergency load redistribution. By testing specimens to outright collapse the investigation identified factors influencing catenary performance and demonstrated that the total energy absorption by work done in catenary action was influenced by the tensile properties and detailing of the specimens. The current ultimate limit criteria and theoretical approach to ultimate load prediction in catenary response have been critically reviewed using results obtained in testing. The findings have been implemented in an analytical study of collapse resistance by ultimate catenary response. A series of exemplar floor systems, of different size and detailing arrangements have been examined.

Second, terrorist groups typically lack the mastery to carry out successful cyber attacks which are exponentially more difficult than non-cyber terrorism. Third, the destructive potential of non-cyber attacks can be far more readily materialised than that of cyber attacks.

As rhetoric, the title certainly works well to raise fears about North America\u2019s future economic role. It also works in concretizing a popular view of globalization, a view that obscures its uneven, discordant, and decidedly unflat processes and practices. In this paper I help deconstruct this view by fleshing out the everyday ways through which United States expanded economically in its early (1890\u20141927) global empire. Based on archival work in Argentina, Russia, Scotland, and the United States, I provide a historical look at encounters between North American business men and women and their foreign customers, students, and workers. Focusing on the diverse practices and personal encounters that were critical to the early global efforts of select United States-based corporations, I expose the uneven, contested, and messy ways in which economic expansion works.

The specific themes of this article are a discussion of the periodization of anarchism as an ism, an ideology originating in nineteenth-century Europe, and its relationship to and differences with more general libertarian or noncoercive modes of behavior and organization found in all human societies. Secondly, the dissemination of anarchism (and syndicalism) throughout the globe and thus the role of the Global South in the history of anarchism will be surveyed. This article focuses on the period of classical anarchism (1860s to 1940s) and therefore discusses the differences between preanarchism and classical anarchism on the one hand, and classical anarchism and postanarchism on the other. Once that is established, which in turn sets the context for the ideology of classical anarchism, the article proceeds to examine the dissemination and reception of anarchism from the 1880s to 1914 in many ways the heyday of anarchism as a global movement, in which it competed with, and at times challenged, the hegemony of social democracy.

I argue that prisoners elucidated a nationalist philosophy of racial formation that saw racism as a site of confinement but racial identity as a vehicle for emancipation. Trying to force the country to see its sites of punishment as discriminatory locations of repression, prisoners used spectacular confrontation to dramatize their conditions of confinement as epitomizing American inequality. I investigate this radicalism as an effort to secure visibility, understood here as a metric of collective consciousness. In documenting the ways prisoners were symbols and spokespeople of 1970s racial protest, this dissertation argues that the prison served as metaphor and metonym in the process of racial formation. A concept and an institution, the prison was embodied in protest, hidden in punishment, represented in media, and known in ideas. This dissertation examines the multifaceted mechanisms by which social movements attempt to effect change through creating new ways of knowing. I examine prison visibility through two extended case studies. First, I study a coterie of radical black prisoners centered in California and revolving around militant prisoner author George Jackson. Through appeals to revolutionary action as racial authenticity, this grouping\u2014which included Angela Davis, Ruchell Magee, and the San Quentin 6, as well as the Black Panther Party and others\u2014described black prisoners as slaves rebelling against the confinement of American society writ large. The second case study addresses the successful decade-long campaign to free five Puerto Rican Nationalists imprisoned for spectacular attacks on U.S. authority in the 1950s. Understanding colonialism as a prison, U.S.based Puerto Rican nationalists in the 1970s (including the Young Lords, the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional, the Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional and others) defined the freedom of these prisoners as a necessary step toward national independence. Through strategies of visibility, black and Puerto Rican prison radicals used collective memory to overcome the spatial barriers of confinement. Such memories were recalled through a wide range of tactics, from bombs to bombast, from alternative media to community organizing, as prison radicals fought to control the terms of their visibility.

The idiom\u2019s transposition to Mumbai represented, in part, a contest over American rhetorical capital. Re-territorialized as \u2018India\u2019s 9/11\u2019, the idiom has re-signified a range of local interests, aspirations, and contests over urban space and identity in Mumbai. In this context, I examine two symmetrical developments within the civic spaces of the city in the immediate aftermath. The first involves the emergence of an upwardly mobile middle class and elite as it took the form of collective survivor-spectator, appearing as a coherent, highly visible and effective public agent. The second involves an apparent suspension of competing narratives of urban terror, which in the past have been enacted through demotic violence in the form of the communal riot. The article suggests that these developments in Mumbai must be read through the city\u2019s incorporation into an emergent narrative of \u2018global\u2019 or so-called \u20189/11-type\u2019 terror.

At these scales, landscape dynamics is dominated by water, sediment and biological routing mediated by fluvial, oceanic, atmospheric processes and human dynamics is dominated by simplifying, profit-maximizing market forces and political action based on projection of economic effect. Also at these scales, landscapes impact humans through patterns of natural disasters and trends such as sea level rise; humans impact landscapes by the effect of economic activity and changes meant to mitigate natural disasters and longer term trends. Based on this analysis, human-landscape coupled systems can be modeled using heterogeneous agents employing prediction models to determine actions to represent the nonlinear behavior of economic and political systems and rule-based routing algorithms to represent landscape processes.
