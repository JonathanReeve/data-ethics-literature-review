In this paper we explore a variety of educational and activist game approaches, and look specifically at the themes emerging from recent projects involving game design for young women. We articulate here design practices in a methodology, Values at Play (VAP), that could be used in the creation of games as well as the teaching of game design.", "venue": "CHI", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 67, "citationCount": 83, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145481282", "name": "M.
