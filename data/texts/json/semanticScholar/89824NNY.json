In what situations do people become aware of algorithms? How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people's use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this article examines people's personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary \u2013 ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function \u2013 is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount": 373, "influentialCitationCount": 31, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38516982", "name": "Taina Bucher"}]}
