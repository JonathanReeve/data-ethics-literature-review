In fact, we claim that agile processes of software development lend themselves specifically well for this endeavour. First, we contend that ethical evaluations need to go beyond the use of software products and include an evaluation of the software itself. This implies that software engineers influence peoples\u2019 lives through the features of their designed products. Embedded values are thus approached best by software engineers themselves. Therefore, we put emphasis on the possibility to implement ethical deliberations in already existing and well established agile software development processes. Our approach relies on software engineers making their own judgments throughout the entire development process to ensure that technical features and ethical evaluation can be addressed adequately to transport and foster desirable values and norms. We argue that agile software development processes may help the implementation of ethical deliberation for five reasons: 1) agile methods are widely spread, 2) their emphasis on flat hierarchies promotes independent thinking, 3) their reliance on existing team structures serve as an incubator for deliberation, 4) agile development enhances object-focused techno-ethical realism, and, finally, 5) agile structures provide a salient endpoint to deliberation. Software might not literally be \u201ceating the world\u201d (Andreessen 2011) \u2013 it did, however, revolutionize the way we do business, then changed the way we live and has now begun to influence the way we think. While software is supposed to enhance human abilities, it seems, sometimes, that it rather reduces the number of options that might be available to a person. The development processes for software were mainly designed as a response to the requirement for software to adapt to business needs which in turn change rapidly in a globally connected world. Software can influence decisions, amplify bias, exacerbate unfairness and perpetuate existing inequalities and it should therefore no longer be reduced to a mere tool for doing business. Software developers need to consider the implications of their products which in turn depend on the values (implicitly) embedded into the software design. When weighing two options, for example, developers cannot solely focus on technical and business needs: They need an ethos to moor their decisions and a pr\u00e2xis that steers sound ethical deliberation. In this paper, we focus on pr\u00e2xis that entails types of actions that constitute life forms instead of individual actions and that by simple addition makeup lifeplans (c.f.

The overlap between these stakeholder groups are explored, as well as whether their concerns are reflected in the existing literature.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData collection was performed using focus groups, and the data was analysed using a thematic analysis. The data was also analysed to determine if there were overlaps between the literature and the stakeholders\u2019 concerns and attitudes towards computing ethics.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results of the focus group analysis show a mixture of overlapping concerns between the different groups, as well as some concerns that are unique to each of the specific groups. All groups stressed the importance of data as a key topic in computing ethics. This includes concerns around the accuracy, completeness and representativeness of data sets used to develop computing applications. Academics were concerned with the best ways to teach computing ethics to university students.

We find that Redditors (Reddit users) rarely use or talk about voting in the way the platform intends. For the most part, Redditors not only disregard the rules about voting but also make, and enforce, their own rules, norms, and ethics around it. We uncover a rich set of voting practices that we present as the following four themes in a conceptual framework: (1) platform culture, (2) prescriptive device, (3) materialization of value, and (4) ontology of self. Drawing on a sociomaterial lens, we reposition voting as a material-discursive practice that is inseparable to Reddit culture.

One such popular SBD methodology is called value sensitive design (VSD). A central tenet of this design methodology is to investigate stakeholder values and design those values into technologies during early stage research and development. To accomplish this, the VSD framework mandates that designers consult the philosophical and ethical literature to best determine how to weigh moral trade-offs. However, the VSD framework also concedes the universalism of moral values, particularly the values of freedom, autonomy, equality trust and privacy justice. This paper argues that the VSD methodology, particularly applied to nano-bio-info-cogno technologies, has an insufficient grounding for the determination of moral values. As such, an exploration of the value-investigations of VSD are deconstructed to illustrate both its strengths and weaknesses.

Even though many different approaches to end-user empowerment have been proposed, it is hardly clear what \"end-user (human) empowerment\" is and how it is possible to develop \"end-user empowering systems\". This paper offers an interdisciplinary perspective on how it can be possible to arrive at a synthesized concept of end-user empowerment, in particular regarding the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The provided interdisciplinary perspective includes concepts from Computer Science, Information Systems, Cognitive Science, Psychology, Sociology, Science-Technology-Society, Design, System Science and Philosophy. Based on an interdisciplinary literature review, and from an enactivist, pluralist, and constructivist perspective, we argue that the individual end-users and their needs and values, as well as the environment (including socioeconomical contexts, other actors, etc.) and technologies they interact with, continuously co-create the conception of end-user empowerment. Moreover, we propose that perceiving technological development as co-creation, and considering technologies as value-bearers could provide the first steps in the development of conceptual frameworks required for the development of end-user empowering systems.", "venue": "HICSS", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1582869438", "name": "Rita Gsenger"}, {"authorId": "3466153", "name": "Soheil Human"}, {"authorId": "38831063", "name": "G.

It is becoming evident that these technological developments are consequential to people\u2019s fundamental human rights. Despite increasing attention to these urgent challenges in recent years, technical solutions to these complex socio-ethical problems are often developed without empirical study of societal context and the critical input of societal stakeholders who are impacted by the technology.

Traditionally, VSD methods assume that we can identify relevant values during the design phase of new technologies. The underlying assumption is that there is only epistemic uncertainty about which values will be impacted by a technology. VSD methods suggest that one can predict which values will be affected by new technologies by increasing knowledge about how values are interpreted or understood in context. In contrast, digital platforms exhibit a novel form of uncertainty, namely, ontological uncertainty : even with full information and overview, it cannot be foreseen what users or developers will do with digital platforms. Hence, predictions about which values are affected might not hold. In this paper, we suggest expanding VSD methods to account for value dynamism resulting from ontological uncertainty. Our expansions involve (1) extending VSD to the entire lifecycle of a platform, (2) broadening VSD through the addition of reflexivity, i.e. second-order learning about what values to aim at, and (3) adding specific tools of moral sandboxing and moral prototyping to enhance such reflexivity.

We review the extensive and complex elements of human moral competence and ask how analogous competences could be implemented in a robot. We propose that moral competence consists of five elements, two constituents (moral norms and moral vocabulary) and three activities (moral judgment, moral action, and moral communication). A robot\u2019s computational representations of social and moral norms is a prerequisite for all three moral activities. However, merely programming in advance the vast network of human norms is impossible, so new computational learning algorithms are needed that allow robots to acquire and update the context-specific and graded norms relevant to their domain of deployment. Moral vocabulary is needed primarily for moral communication, which expresses moral judgments of others\u2019 violations and explains one\u2019s own moral violations \u2013 to justify them, apologize, or declare intentions to do better.

This is particularly important for (weak) AI-technologies that are increasingly shaping today\u2019s society. When Microsoft released its AI chatbot Tay on Twitter in March 2016, Tay was supposed to learn to chat as an average American teenage girl. However, she quickly became sexist, racist, and anti-Semitic. Microsoft turned out to be overly naive about the intentions of Twitter users who had to \u2018train\u2019 Tay and, in doing so, the developers did not properly acknowledge their ethical responsibility. Even though technology\u2019s non-neutrality has become generally accepted within the fields of ethics and philosophy of technology, other disciplines, such as engineering and computer science, often still adhere to the view that technology itself is neutral. Yet, technology mediates our actions and perceptions in numerous ways. Today, algorithms not only have an important share in how we see the world, they can also predict our future behaviour. Neither algorithms nor datasets are inherently neutral; on the contrary, users\u2019 and developers\u2019 biases can seep into them. Overall, this paper seeks to give attention to the non-neutrality of AI-technologies, the ethical responsibility of its developers, and the soft impacts of existing and emerging AI-technologies.

New advances \u2013 not only the Internet, social media, and artificial intelligence but also novel techniques for controlling reproduction or dealing with climate change \u2013 make clear that scientific and technological innovations bring both risks and benefits to human rights. Efforts to protect and promote human rights have to take seriously the ways in which these technologies, and the forms of knowledge creation, production, and dissemination they enable, can create harms and be exploited to violate rights. At the same time, human rights practitioners must continue to seek creative ways to make use of new technologies to improve the human condition. This dichotomy is the central tension that animates both this volume and the emerging field of human rights technology. The overriding purpose of the volume, and of the University of Connecticut workshop that launched it, is to encourage human rights institutions, experts, and practitioners to take seriously the risks and opportunities of technology for the promotion and protection of human rights. The volume uses diverse case studies to examine how the dynamic of intertwined threat and opportunity plays out in a range of contexts. Case studies focus on assisted reproductive technologies, autonomous lethal weapons, climate change technology, the Internet and social media, and water meters. Considering the relationship between technology and human rights across these diverse areas reveals areas of both continuity and discontinuity in terms of how technology affects the enjoyment of human rights. We begin by laying out the principles that animate the project. These principles have been derived chiefly from international human rights law and practice, and also draw on the scholarly study of science, technology, and the law. Based on these principles, we define a \u201chuman rights\u201d approach to the study of technology. Finally, we identify and analyze the cross-cutting themes that unite the", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "118734022", "name": "Molly K.

Value-sensitive design (VSD) has been recommended as a promising approach for addressing moral values in controversial energy cases. This paper aims to empirically explore the applicability of VSD in controversial energy cases by investigating the extent to which it is possible to identify the relevant values, norms and design requirements in the Groningen gas controversy (the Netherlands) using values hierarchies. It was found in this case that the relevant values, norms and design requirements could be retrieved, but that two conditions need to be fulfilled to avoid underexposure of relevant values. Firstly, data should be collected using a variety of data sources. Secondly, these sources should be analyzed through both top-down approaches and bottom-up approaches.

Social media, and people\u2019s online self-presentations and social networks, add complexity to decisions about how to manage information disclosure and changing identities. This dissertation focuses on how people present and disclose changing identities on social media during life transitions, and how these changes impact emotional wellbeing. I use gender transition as a case study to understand the relationships between identity disclosure, emotional wellbeing, and social support in online contexts, and how people experience liminality on social media. I examined transgender people\u2019s transition experiences using data from transition blogs on Tumblr, a social media blogging site on which people document their gender transitions. I analyzed text data from these blogs using methods including sentiment analysis and statistical inference, followed by qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with transgender bloggers. I contribute an empirical examination of how people\u2019s emotional wellbeing changes over time through the gender transition process. Transgender identity disclosures to family members are associated with decreased emotional wellbeing in the short term, followed by increased emotional wellbeing in the long term. Facebook disclosures, an efficient means of mass disclosure, are associated with increased emotional wellbeing for those whose Facebook networks were supportive. However, over a longer time period post-transition, people\u2019s emotional wellbeing is impacted by other life events that take precedence, intersecting identity facets, and the ups and downs of life more broadly. To conceptualize these results, I apply ethnographer van Gennep\u2019s liminality framework to a social media context and contribute a new understanding of liminality by arguing that reconstructing one\u2019s online identity during life transitions is a rite of passage. During life transitions, people present multiple identities and do transition work simultaneously on different social media sites that together act as what I call social transition machinery.

However, there remains a need for clearly articulated case studies describing not only the engineering of obfuscation mechanisms but, further, providing a critical appraisal of obfuscation\u2019s fit for specific socio-technical applications. This is the aim of our paper, which presents our experiences designing, implementing, and distributing AdNauseam, an open-source browser extension that leverages obfuscation to frustrate tracking by online advertisers. At its core, AdNauseam works like a list-based blocker, hiding or blocking ads and trackers. However, it provides two additional features. First, it collects the ads it finds in its \u2018Vault\u2019, allowing users to interactively explore the ads they have been served, and providing insight into the algorithmic profiles created by advertising networks. Second, AdNauseam simulates clicks on ads in order to confuse trackers and diminish the value of aggregated tracking data. A critic might ask: why click? Why not simply hide ads from users and hide users from trackers? The twofold answer reveals what may be distinctive elements of the AdNauseam approach. To begin, we conceptualize privacy as a societal value. Whereas many privacy tools offer solutions only for individual users, AdNauseam is built on the assumption that, often, effective privacy protection must be infused throughout a system. This assumption presents different and interesting engineering challenges. Second, AdNauseam seeks to concurrently achieve the goal of resistance through protest. And since protest frequently involves being vocal, AdNauseam\u2019s core design conflicts at times with conceptions of privacy based on secrecy or concealment. While such tensions, and the tradeoffs that result, are not uncommon in privacy engineering, the process of designing and building AdNauseam demanded their systematic consideration. In this paper we present challenges faced in attempting to apply obfuscation to a new domain, that of online tracking by advertisers. We begin with the goals of the project and the implemented features to which they map. We then present our engineering approach, the set of tensions that arose during implementation, and the ways in which these tensions were addressed. We discuss our initial evaluation efforts on both technical and ethical dimensions, and some of the challenges that remain. We conclude with thoughts on the broader issues facing privacy tools that must operate within complex sociotechnical contexts\u2014especially those dominated by actors openly resistant to them\u2014informed by our experience with AdNauseam\u2019s ban from Google\u2019s Chrome store.", "venue": "IWPE@SP", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39774770", "name": "D.

To explore how gender is baked into platform design, this article investigates the 10 most popular English-speaking social media platforms by performing recorded walkthroughs from two different subject positions: (1) a new user registering an account, and (2) a new advertiser creating an ad. We explore several different spaces in social media software where designers commonly program gender\u2014sign-up pages, profile pages, and advertising portals\u2014to consider (1) how gender is made durable through social media design, and (2) the shifting composition of the category of gender within the social media ecosystem more broadly. Through this investigation, we question how these categorizations attribute meaning to gender as they materialize in different software spaces, along with the recursive implications for society. Ultimately, our analysis reveals how social media platforms act as intermediaries within the larger ecosystem of advertising and web analytics companies.

The papers report empirical evidence of values, power, and politics in material properties, policy decisions and mechanisms of interoperability across a wide variety of infrastructures, including digital e-book repositories, mobile applications, online discussion forums, cyber-security and the Internet as a whole. Together, the papers (1) reflect the many and diverse ways that values, power and politics can influence digital infrastructure and (2) propose new theoretical perspectives on those relationships. Further, the research presented in this session illustrates the ways that human entanglements with infrastructure\u2014whether user adaptations or professional interventions\u2014impact the functionality of those infrastructures.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 6, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3214594", "name": "Katie Shilton"}, {"authorId": "2280093", "name": "Jaime Snyder"}]}}]}
