Freedom of speech on social media has thus become a matter of concern, with calls for better regulation. Public debate revolves around content moderation, seen by some as necessary to remove harmful content, yet as censorship by others. In this article, we argue that the current debate is exclusively focused on the speaking side of speech but overlooks an important way in which platforms have come to interfere with free speech on the audience side. Rather than simply speaking to one\u2019s follower network, algorithms now organise speech on social media with the aim to increase user engagement and marketability for targeted advertising. The result is that audiences for speech are now decided algorithmically, a phenomenon we term \u2018algorithmic audiencing\u2019. We put forward algorithmic audiencing as a discovery, a novel phenomenon that has been overlooked so far. We show that it interferes with free speech in unprecedented ways not possible in pre-digital times, by amplifying or suppressing speech for economic gain, which in turn distorts the free and fair exchange of ideas in public discourse. When black-boxed algorithms determine who we speak to the problematic for free speech changes from \u2018what can be said\u2019 to \u2018what will be heard\u2019 and \u2018by whom\u2019.

These debates often hinge on whether any of the established rationales for media regulation apply to social media. This paper argues that the public resource rationale that has been utilized in traditional media regulation in the U.S. applies to social media. The public resource rationale contends that, when a media outlet utilizes a public resource \u2013 such as the broadcast spectrum, or public rights of way \u2013 the outlet must abide by certain public interest obligations that may infringe upon its First Amendment rights.

It is about cartoonconsumer relationship in an effort to discover the impacts of animated cartoons on children in Nairobi. It also raises awareness on the implications of raising children in Nairobi on an animated cartoon content that is designed mainly from Euro-American and not local values, attitudes and sensibilities. It is hoped that the findings and conclusions herein will help generate cartoons that can educate Kenyan children to live in ways that are socially and culturally desirable. Methodology: The study used descriptive survey method to collect information through casual interviews and self-administered questionnaires. Findings: This study suggests that animated cartoons have discernible impacts on children in Nairobi in that they influence the children to construct their worldview and create perceptions that are alien to Kenya. Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: Between the ages of seven to eleven years children are excellent imitators but poor evaluators, therefore, the non-African ideals and values portrayed in the animated cartoons are increasingly defining the perception and attitudes towards gender roles, sexuality, body images and role modelling of children who consume animated cartoons in Nairobi. This is because these children are in that stage where images and impressions from diverse environments play a big part in how they construct their world.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 15, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "118870434", "name": "M.

Most recently, platform companies like Facebook and Twitter have been summoned to testify about bots as part of investigations into digitally-enabled foreign manipulation during the 2016 US Presidential election. Facing mounting pressure from both the public and from legislators, these companies have been instructed to crack down on apparently malicious bot accounts. But as this article demonstrates, since the earliest writings on bots in the 1990s, there has been substantial confusion as to exactly what a 'bot' is and what exactly a bot does. We argue that multiple forms of ambiguity are responsible for much of the complexity underlying contemporary bot-related policy, and that before successful policy interventions can be formulated, a more comprehensive understanding of bots --- especially how they are defined and measured --- will be needed. In this article, we provide a history and typology of different types of bots, provide clear guidelines to better categorize political automation and unpack the impact that it can have on contemporary technology policy, and outline the main challenges and ambiguities that will face both researchers and legislators concerned with bots in the future.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 91, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "35630546", "name": "Robert Gorwa"}, {"authorId": "27558311", "name": "Douglas Guilbeault"}]}}, {"isInfluential": true, "contexts": ["\u2026of the negative obligations (i.e. obligations to police/protect against the circulation of certain types of speech) associated with media companies\u2019 (Napoli and Caplan, 2017: 16), as well as \u2018more intensive government oversight, in the form of affirmative obligations to serve the public interest\u2026", "Napoli and Caplan\u2019s (2017) recent article follows earlier work such as that of Tarleton Gillespie (2010) in addressing the long history of social media companies such as Facebook, \u2018insisting they are not news organizations, or even media companies, at all\u2019 (Napoli and Caplan, 2017: 1) in order to be treated as technology companies.", "\u2026of speech) associated with media companies\u2019 (Napoli and Caplan, 2017: 16), as well as \u2018more intensive government oversight, in the form of affirmative obligations to serve the public interest and more stringent regulation in areas such as concentration of ownership\u2019 (Napoli and Caplan, 2017: 8).", "Napoli and Caplan\u2019s (2017) recent article follows earlier work such as that of Tarleton Gillespie (2010) in addressing the long history of social media companies such as Facebook, \u2018insisting they are not news organizations, or even media companies, at all\u2019 (Napoli and Caplan, 2017: 1) in order to be treated as technology companies.

Journalists and technologists expressed a shared assumption that Silicon Valley platforms have taken an intermediary gatekeeping role between journalism and citizens. Silicon Valley actors expressed common values such as a belief that technological solutions can be found for societal problems and that information should be freely accessible. To the extent that institutions are influenced by discourse and discourse shapes understanding of journalism and other institutional actors, the findings suggested Silicon Valley could be understood as an emerging institution that has gained control of a societal sector of exchanging information over digital networks. Silicon Valley and journalism actors expressed common concerns such as a need for citizens to have information they need to participate in democracy. However, Silicon Valley actors did not express a belief that the values of journalism are necessary to achieve those outcomes.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount": 10, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "117579036", "name": "F.
