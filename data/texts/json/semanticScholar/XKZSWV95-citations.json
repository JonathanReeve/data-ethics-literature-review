However, most works either classify a single emotion per video stimuli, or are restricted to static, desktop environments. To address this, we propose a correlation-based emotion recognition algorithm (CorrNet) to recognize the valence and arousal (V-A) of each instance (fine-grained segment of signals) using only wearable, physiological signals (e.g., electrodermal activity, heart rate). CorrNet takes advantage of features both inside each instance (intra-modality features) and between different instances for the same video stimuli (correlation-based features). We first test our approach on an indoor-desktop affect dataset (CASE), and thereafter on an outdoor-mobile affect dataset (MERCA) which we collected using a smart wristband and wearable eyetracker. Results show that for subject-independent binary classification (high-low), CorrNet yields promising recognition accuracies: 76.37% and 74.03% for V-A on CASE, and 70.29% and 68.15% for V-A on MERCA. Our findings show: (1) instance segment lengths between 1\u20134 s result in highest recognition accuracies (2) accuracies between laboratory-grade and wearable sensors are comparable, even under low sampling rates (\u226464 Hz) (3) large amounts of neutral V-A labels, an artifact of continuous affect annotation, result in varied recognition performance.", "venue": "Sensors", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 131, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "50615706", "name": "Tianyi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2042285466", "name": "Abdallah El Ali"}, {"authorId": "2109117671", "name": "Chen Wang"}, {"authorId": "1718099", "name": "A.

The most prominent conference venue is the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) with 17 papers, followed by theACMConference onComputer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) with 14 papers (not including one CSCW paper that was published in the Proceedings of the ACM on HCI (CSCW) because CSCW \u2014 like many other conferences \u2014 recently switched to a journal publishing method). The ACM International Conference on Supporting GroupWork (GROUP) with four and the ACM Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) conference with two publications are the only further sources of conference proceedings with more than one publication. Among the journals, only ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI) is recurring with two publications. For an overview of the citation frequency of the publications, please refer to Figure 3, where also the short names of the publication venues are depicted next to the year and last name of the first author (further adding to RQ9). Two of the publications really stand out when it comes to citation frequency because they have 1,813 [152] and 1,328 [80] citations (which is indicated by red-colored bars and a label on the respective bar in Figure 3). The next most cited paper has the comparatively lower number of 390 citations [131], and then only nine publications have more than 100 citations. The mean number of citations in our final corpus is 100.37 and the median is 21.5 (due to a lower number of crass outliers as mentioned before) which shows that it is a well cited selection. Recently, Correia et al. [37] identified the average number of citations in the broader field of CSCW as measured through the venues JCSCW, ACM CSCW, GROUP, and ECSCW to be at least 39 per paper, and therefore, vaguely comparable to our subset of publications on HCM. Only four of the publications in our corpus have either zero citations or one citation (from the years 2012, 2014 and two of 2018 which still have the potential to receive citations in the upcoming years) which together with the average number of citations hints at a reasonable impact of the published research. However, when looking at the chart, one could gain the impression that the most influential publications were created starting at the end of the 1980s and up until the ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

With the embedded cameras and microphones in these devices, this 'invasion' of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. Because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as asking the owner to \"turn the camera off\"), these devices may still record information because of the lack of a 'real' off button. With the ambiguities of current designs, a bystander's perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. Indeed, being able to assess one's actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one's privacy according to Altman's theory of boundary regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. To understand how people as bystanders manage their privacy with IoT devices, we conducted an interview study about people's perceptions of and behaviors around current IoT devices. We find that although participants' behaviors line up with Altman's theory of boundary regulation, in the face of uncertainty about their privacy, they desire or engage in various 'tangible' workarounds. Based on our findings, we identify and introduce the concept of 'tangible privacy' as being essential to boundary regulation with IoT devices. We argue that IoT devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders.", "venue": "Proc.

To mitigate this problem, we propose a deep learning-based approach that recognizes everyday activities in egocentric photos that have been intentionally degraded in quality to preserve the privacy of bystanders. An evaluation on 2 annotated datasets collected in the field with a combined total of 84,078 egocentric photos showed activity recognition performance with accuracy between 79% and 88% across 17 and 21 activity classes when the images were subjected to blurring (mean filter k=20). To confirm that image degradation does indeed raise the perception of bystander privacy, we conducted a crowd sourced validation study with 640 participants; it showed a statistically significant positive relationship between the amount of image degradation and participants' willingness to be captured by wearable cameras.

Biosensors capture physiological signals in addition to kinesthetic data to draw intimate inferences about individuals' mental states. The proliferation of sensors makes detection, interpretation, and inference of these previously subtle - or otherwise invisible - emotional and physiological signals possible from proximate and remote locations. These sensors pose unprecedented challenges to individual privacy in public through remote, precise, and passively collected data. This paper examines the unique nature and inferential potential of biosensed data by creating a taxonomy of signals that may be collected remotely, via casual contact, or from traces left behind, and considers how these data may be collected and used to create novel privacy concerns - particularly in public. Since biosignals may often be deduced from visual data, this paper uses historic and recent photography cases to explore how social norms evolved in response to remote collection in public. A contextual integrity privacy heuristic is then used to probe the need for new norms and remedies specifically for biosensing privacy threats.

Evidently, information technology is no longer a neutral tool. Intentionally or otherwise, system designers and developers influence our attitudes and/or behaviors for varying motives including promotion of socially valued activities. However, promoting moral values using technologies raises several ethical concerns. For example, what might be ethical for one person could be completely unethical from the other. Moral justification of persuasive systems requires involving all stakeholders in a rationale and open argumentation process. The moral issues are difficult to perceive and comprehend and more importantly, the entire process involves different stakeholders with conflicting viewpoints. Therefore, it is challenging to find an optimal solution to satisfy all stakeholders and argumentation process encompasses both cognitive and social complexities. In an attempt to address the problem; this study outlines an argumentation-based design rationale application. The proposed solution is to mitigate social and cognitive complexities pertaining to moral justification process. The main aim of this thesis is to study construction and evaluation of the said solution in order to facilitate reflective design and evaluation of persuasive information systems. This study follows formal problem-centric approach and was conducted by applying Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. We carried out an experiment to examine socio-technical aspects of the designed artifact focusing on system usefulness and its effect on the problem context. System usefulness of the artifact was studied by analyzing perceived usefulness and usability of the solution from participants' opinions. The intended implication of this study was to examine that argumentation-based design rationale could potentially decrease complexity of argumentation process. Likewise, it could lead to improved communication and reasoning between stakeholders. These aspects do not guarantee design and development of information systems that are morally justifiable by all standards. However, it is suggested that there are certain prerequisites that are needed for moral justification of persuasive information systems.

For this intelligence to emerge three challenges have to be addressed, namely the challenge of appropriate awareness abstractions, the challenge of supportive interactive tools, and the challenge of infrastructure. The thesis argues that in order to advance towards social intelligent awareness systems, we should be able to interpret and predict the success or failure of such systems in relationship to their communicational objectives and their implications for the social interactions they support. The FN-AAR (Focus-Nimbus Aspects Attributes Resources) model is introduced as a formal model which by capturing the general characteristics of the awareness-systems domain allows predictions about socially salient patterns pertaining to human communication and brings clarity to the discussion around relevant concepts such as social translucency, symmetry, and deception. The thesis recognizes that harnessing the benefits of context awareness can be problematic for end-users and other affected individuals, who may not always be able to anticipate, understand or appreciate system function, and who may so feel their own sense of autonomy and privacy threatened. It introduces a set of tools and mechanisms that support end-user control, system intelligibility and accountability. This is achieved by minimizing the cognitive effort needed to handle the increased complexity of such systems and by enhancing the ability of people to configure and maintain intelligent environments. We show how these tools and mechanisms empower end-users to answer questions such as \"how does the system behave\", \"why is something happening\", \"how would the system behave in response to a change in context\", and \"how can the system\u2019s behaviour be altered\" to achieve intelligibility, accountability, and end-user control. Finally, the thesis argues that awareness applications overall can not be examined as static configurations of services and functions, and that they should be seen as the results of both implicit and explicit interaction with the user. Amelie is introduced as a supportive framework for the development of context-aware applications that encourages the design of the interactive mechanisms through which end-users can control, direct and advance such systems dynamically throughout their deployment. Following the recombinant computing approach, Amelie addresses the implications of infrastructure design decisions on user experience, while by adopting the premises of the FN-AAR model Amelie supports the direct implementation of systems that allow end-users to meet social needs and to practice extant social skills.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 156, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144443959", "name": "G.

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems operate 24/7 almost everywhere, from homes to shops to public squares, and are used for vastly varied purposes. For example, some cameras might protect certain spaces against theft and vandalism, but restaurant managers might use them to watch for tables in need of service. Existing recording technologies help us study the issues inherent to emergent pervasive computing applications, including how people reason about such technologies, assess their presence or absence, and consider the data they record. In turn, these processes provide insight into how people can and should be informed about the context of recording (who does it, when, where, and how). As more pervasive recording technologies enter the research and market spaces, understanding how and when to inform people about recording will become even more important. Despite this need, grounded reactions to recording technologies can be difficult for researchers to obtain. For example, the Pew Internet Project asked experts to speculate on the future of recording technologies and found that approximately half of those involved in Internet technologies believed that, by 2020, the benefits of recording technologies wouldn\u2019t be worth the cost paid in the loss of privacy.2 Various other projects have focused on directly querying concepts about pervasive recording in town squares and other public arenas.3 These studies all follow a similar approach: ask people about hypothetical or abstract situations regarding emergent pervasive recording technologies.

Simultaneously, there is a growing market for mobile \"personal safety\" devices. As these trends merge, there will be significant implications for parent-teen relationships, affecting domains such as privacy, trust, and maturation. Not only the teen and his or her parents are affected; other important stakeholders include the teen's friends who may be unwittingly monitored. This problem space, with less clear-cut assets, risks, and affected parties, thus lies well outside of more typical computer security applications.\n To help understand this problem domain and what, if anything, should be built, we turn to the theory and methods of Value Sensitive Design, a systematic approach to designing for human values in technology. We first develop value scenarios that highlight potential issues, benefits, harms, and challenges. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 participants (9 teens and their parents). Results show significant differences with respect to information about: 1) internal state (e.g., mood) versus external environment (e.g., location) state; 2) situation (e.g., emergency vs. non-emergency); and 3) awareness (e.g., notification vs. non-notification). The value scenario and interview results positioned us to identify key technical challenges -- such as strongly protecting the privacy of a teen's contextual information during ordinary situations but immediately exposing that information to others as appropriate in an emergency -- and corresponding architectural levers for these technologies.\n In addition to laying a foundation for future work in this area, this research serves as a prototypical example of using Value Sensitive Design to explicate the underlying human values in complex security domains.", "venue": "SOUPS", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 103, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3086349", "name": "Alexei Czeskis"}, {"authorId": "2787625", "name": "Ivayla Dermendjieva"}, {"authorId": "3328398", "name": "Hussein Yapit"}, {"authorId": "143981586", "name": "A.

The first objective is to investigate the current communication practices of family members to stay in touch with each other. Based on this investigation it elicits requirements for new pervasive communication systems, called awareness systems, which aim to support intra-family communication. The second objective is to develop those awareness systems based on the elicited requirements and evaluate them. In this thesis we focus on families who consist of working parents with dependent children living under the same roof. Awareness systems can be defined as a class of computer mediated communication systems that support individuals to maintain, with low effort, a peripheral awareness of each other\u2019s activities and whereabouts. In the context of the research conducted, a variety of methods were used and several applications to conduct the research were developed. More specifically interviews, field studies of two prototypes, web surveys and an adapted version of the experience sampling study were used. The research endeavor started off with an interview study with twenty Dutch parents. The results of the interview were followed up with an online survey study and a prototype evaluation. A follow-up modified experience sampling study (Reconexp) helped in placing the previous findings into context. The objective of Reconexp was to find out the communication needs of busy parents under context. The two prototypes which were created, SchoolAware and FamilyAware embody the primary characteristics of awareness system according to the aforementioned definition. SchoolAware automatically communicated the presence of children in school as well as their schedule information to their parents. FamilyAware gathered multiple sources of awareness information such as place, calendar information, computer activity and automatically exchanged that information between busy parents. Moreover, it enabled parents to exchange messages and photos along with the automatically captured awareness information. This information was presented in mobile phones. The contributions of this thesis are twofold. First the thesis presents the intra-family communication needs that would drive the adoption of awareness systems. Moreover the thesis presents the implications for the design of such systems. Second the thesis examines a modification of the experience sampling method (ESM), the experience sampling and reconstruction method (ESRM).

However, years of work may be required before a complex system, such as the UrbanSim urban simulation system, is deployed and ready for such participation. In this paper, we investigate laying the foundations for public participation in advance of wide-scale public deployment, with the goal of having interaction designs ready when the system is put into such use. Moreover, in a highly politicized domain such as this one, value advocacy as well as factual information plays a central role. Using the theory and methods of Value Sensitive Design, we address three design goals toward public participation and value advocacy, and provide evidence that each of them was achieved: (1) enabling indirect stakeholders to become direct stakeholders (i.e. enabling more people to interact directly with UrbanSim in useful ways); (2) developing a participatory process by which these stakeholders can help guide the development of the system itself; and (3) enabling participating organizations to engage in value advocacy while at the same time enhancing overall system legitimation.", "venue": "DG.O", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 54, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144029598", "name": "Batya Friedman"}, {"authorId": "143981586", "name": "A.

However, these portals often reveal more information to the public area than the office occupant would like. As a result, people often keep doors and window blinds closed, which means that nobody can gather awareness information, even those with whom the occupant would be willing to share. One solution to this problem is a co-present media space - a computer-mediated video connection at the boundary between an office and a public area. These systems can provide both greater privacy control to the occupant and greater overall awareness information to observers. To see how co-present media spaces would work in real world settings, we built what we believe are the first ever co-present media spaces, and deployed them in two offices. From observations gathered over fifteen months, it is clear that the systems can do a better job of balancing the occupant's need for privacy and the observers' need for awareness better, than a standard window. However, we also identified a number of issues that affected the use and the success of the systems: the existence of alternate information sources, confusion with existing social norms, disparities between effort and need, and reduced interactional subtlety for observers in the public area. Our work contributes both a novel arrangement of a media space for co-present collaborators, and the first investigation into the design factors that affect the use and acceptance of these systems.", "venue": "GROUP '07", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3049545", "name": "Hyun Hoi James Kim"}, {"authorId": "1693768", "name": "C.

Any attempt at enhancing social awareness is fundamentally at odds with high levels of user privacy. In this document, we shall discuss a novel sensor network based approach to enhancing the social awareness of people while maintaining low levels of privacy invasiveness. We use a grid of motion sensors to collect anonymous information about activity in various locations of our prototypical workspace. The real time and historical components of the data are then visualized in six different ways. These visualizations are meant to be deployed as glanceable displays in public areas and personal workspaces to allow people to gain an almost subconscious awareness of the space around them. The system developed is evaluated through one on one critique interviews with users drawn randomly from the prototypical workspace. Finally the results of the evaluation are discussed and future directions for the research are outlined.
