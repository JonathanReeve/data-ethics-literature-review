While it may be case that people build artifacts with certain ends in mind \u2013 the values of the people doing the building are not in the artifacts. Why this is so is a function of three things: (1) lack of empirically identifying characteristics of values and (2) an endorsement of a pragmatic conception of values as motivators of human action, and (3) a conception of decision-making that necessarily includes values.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 6, "citationCount": 13, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "41219426", "name": "J.
