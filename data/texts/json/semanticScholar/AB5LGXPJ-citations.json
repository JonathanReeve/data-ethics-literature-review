However, research on morbid curiosity is largely absent from the psychological literature. In this paper, I present a psychometric tool for assessing morbid curiosity, defined as a motivation to seek out information about dangerous phenomena, and use it to investigate the psychological nature of morbid curiosity. In studies 1 and 2 (ntotal\u00a0=\u00a01370), the Morbid Curiosity Scale was developed and its relationship to personality was assessed. Morbidly curious individuals were rebellious, socially curious, and low in animal reminder disgust. Study 3 (n\u00a0=\u00a0317) demonstrated that trait morbid curiosity is stable over 4\u20136\u00a0weeks and that morbidly curious individuals prefer movies where threat is a central theme. In Study 4 (n\u00a0=\u00a0137), participants were presented with a choice between morbid information and non-morbid information (image and text). Morbid curiosity predicted over half the variance (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.53) in decisions to further investigate morbid information. These four studies provide evidence that morbid curiosity is a normally occurring psychological trait that can be assessed using the new 24-item Morbid Curiosity Scale.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "90842190", "name": "Coltan Scrivner"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "50a6db6a18140d5be36a6c017fa393edb09078c7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3190075092", "DOI": "10.1108/oir-03-2021-0121"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50a6db6a18140d5be36a6c017fa393edb09078c7", "title": "Prevalence of anger, engaged in sadness: engagement in misinformation, correction, and emotional tweets during mass shootings", "abstract": "PurposeThe goal of this study is to examine how tweets containing distinct emotions (i.e., emotional tweets) and different information types (i.e., misinformation, corrective information, and others) are prevalent during the initial phase of mass shootings and furthermore, how users engage in those tweets.Design/methodology/approachThe researchers manually coded 1,478 tweets posted between August 3\u201311, 2019, in the immediate aftermath of the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings. This manual coding approach systematically examined the distinct emotions and information types of each tweet.FindingsThe authors found that, on Twitter, misinformation was more prevalent than correction during crises and a large portion of misinformation had negative emotions (i.e., anger, sadness, and anxiety), while correction featured anger. Notably, sadness-exhibiting tweets were more likely to be retweeted and liked by users, but tweets containing other emotions (i.e., anger, anxiety, and joy) were less likely to be retweeted and liked.Research limitations/implicationsOnly a portion of the larger conversation was manually coded. However, the current study provides an overall picture of how tweets are circulated during crises in terms of misinformation and correction, and moreover, how emotions and information types alike influence engagement behaviors.Originality/valueThe pervasive anger-laden tweets about mass shooting incidents might contribute to hostile narratives and eventually reignite political polarization. The notable presence of anger in correction tweets further suggests that those who are trying to provide correction to misinformation also rely on emotion. Moreover, our study suggests that displays of sadness could function in a way that leads individuals to rely on false claims as a coping strategy to counteract uncertainty.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/OIR-03-2021-0121/", "venue": "Online Information Review", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Jiyoung Lee"}, {"authorId": "3467521", "name": "Shaheen Kanthawala"}, {"authorId": "3544353", "name": "Brian C.

This type of promotion is often framed as an in-store event, and consumers experience two properties inherent in gambling: entertainment and varied financial payoffs. Depending on the consumers\u2019 assessments of these two elements, these experiences might drive two postpurchase consequences of such campaigns: customer satisfaction with the retailer and word-of-mouth intention. To assess these effects, two field quasi-experiments with gambled price promotions were conducted: one in a\u00a0candy store and the other in a\u00a0retail furniture store. Two main findings emerge from these studies: (1)\u00a0The customers in both studies endorse gambled price promotions and are more willing to engage in word-of-mouth when participating in such a\u00a0campaign. The effect of gambled price promotions on customer satisfaction is positive in the low-stakes setting of the candy store but insignificant in the furniture store. (2)\u00a0The positive effects of such promotions are mediated by their entertainment value and moderated by the consumers\u2019 assessments of the discount.

Exploring the Relationship Between Social Referrals, Referral Propensity and Stickiness to Video-on-Demand Websites", "abstract": "Content website providers have two main goals: They seek to attract consumers and to keep them on their websites as long as possible. To reach potential consumers, they can utilize several online channels, such as paid search results or advertisements on social media, all of which usually require a substantial marketing budget. However, with rising user numbers of online communication tools, website providers increasingly integrate social sharing buttons on their websites to encourage existing consumers to facilitate referrals to their social networks. While little is known about this social form of guiding consumers to a content website, the study proposes that the way in which consumers reach a website is related to their stickiness to the website and their propensity to refer content to others. By using a unique clickstream data set of a video-on-demand website, the study compares consumers referred by their social network to those consumers arriving at the website via organic search or social media advertisements in terms of stickiness to the website (e.g., visit length, number of page views, video starts) and referral likelihood. The results show that consumers referred through social referrals spend more time on the website, view more pages, and start more videos than consumers who respond to social media advertisements, but less than those coming through organic search. Concerning referral propensity, the results indicate that consumers attracted to a website through social referrals are more likely to refer content to others than those who came through organic search or social media advertisements.

In this paper we investigate the historical dynamics in the use of anachronies in film.

We study this on a corpus of 80 most popular mystery films released in 1970\u20132009. We observe that anachronies have become used more frequently, and in a greater proportion of films. We also find that films that made substantial use of anachronies, on average, distributed the anachronies evenly along film length, while the films that made little use of anachronies placed them near the beginning and end.

Drawing from media studies findings, we hypothesized that their popularity could be driven by Internet users\u2019 desire to interact with their friends and family by sharing phatic posts (i.e. statements with no practical information fulfilling a social function such as \u201chello\u201d or \u201csister, I love you\u201d). We found that phatic posts were the strongest predictor of interactions, followed by posts with a positive emotional valence. While 50% of the posts were related to social relations, only 28% consisted of health misinformation. Despite its cognitive appeal, health misinformation was a negative predictor of interactions. Sexual content negatively predicted interactions and other factors of attraction such as disgust, threat or negative emotions did not predict interactions. These results strengthen the idea that Facebook is first and foremost a social network used by people to foster their social relations, not to spread online misinformation. We encourage researchers working on misinformation to conduct finer-grained analysis of online content and to adopt interdisciplinary approach to study the phatic dimension of communication, together with positive content, to better understand the cultural evolution dynamics of social media.", "venue": "Palgrave Communications", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 103, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "78155360", "name": "M.

The analysis shows that these features are, to a different degree, present in most texts, and thus that general cognitive inclinations may contribute to explain the success of online misinformation. This account can elucidate questions such as whether and why misinformation online is thriving more than accurate information, or the role of \u2018fake news\u2019 as a weapon of political propaganda. Online misinformation, while being an umbrella term covering many different phenomena, can be characterised, in this perspective, not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency.

Almost 20 years ago, Henrich and Gil-White (H&GW) suggested that people use indirect cues of success (e.g., differential levels of attention paid to models by other social learners) as adaptive short-cuts to select models from whom to learn. They called this use of indirect markers of success prestige bias. In this review, we re-visit H&GW\u2019s proposal, examining the evidence amassed since for the adaptiveness and use of prestige bias in humans. First, we briefly outline H&GW\u2019s theory. Second, we analyse whether prestige is associated with competence within valuable domains, which is a crucial assumption underlying the adaptiveness of prestige bias. Third, we discuss prestige cues that people use to infer success (e.g., the amount of voluntary deference and attention received by models).

More specifically, we aim to show that with the increasing familiarity of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d, its story frame and characters have gradually become part of the author and audience\u2019s shared world knowledge, which is encoded in the type of linguistic devices used to introduce the characters. To this end, we performed a Bayesian logistic regression analysis on a diachronic collection (late 18th century\u20132015) of the world\u2019s most iconic fairy tale, using automatically generated time estimations for a subset of undated reproductions in the story lineage, and including these estimates and approximated measurement errors in the statistical model. Results show that there is indeed a marked increase of linguistic markers that indicate that the characters are already known or \u201caccessible\u201d to the audience. This development reflects the author\u2019s changing intuitions and beliefs about the familiarity of the story, and, indirectly, the changing expectations of the story\u2019s audience regarding the appearance of certain characters in the story frame. Notably, this study is the first to quantitatively describe the diachronic development of a story (and the concepts associated with it) into the realm of \u2018shared knowledge\u2019, showing that it is a slow and gradual process.

An Integrative Functional Review", "abstract": "The role of disgust in moral psychology has been a matter of much controversy and experimentation over the past 20 or so years. We present here an integrative look at the literature, organized according to the four functions of emotion proposed by integrative functional theory: appraisal, associative, self-regulation, and communicative. Regarding appraisals, we review experimental, personality, and neuroscientific work that has shown differences between elicitors of disgust and anger in moral contexts, with disgust responding more to bodily moral violations such as incest, and anger responding more to sociomoral violations such as theft. We also present new evidence for interpreting the phenomenon of sociomoral disgust as an appraisal of bad character in a person. The associative nature of disgust is shown by evidence for \u201cunreasoning disgust,\u201d in which associations to bodily moral violations are not accompanied by elaborated reasons, and not modified by appraisals such as harm or intent. We also critically examine the literature about the ability of incidental disgust to intensify moral judgments associatively. For disgust's self-regulation function, we consider the possibility that disgust serves as an existential defense, regulating avoidance of thoughts that might threaten our basic self-image as living humans. Finally, we discuss new evidence from our lab that moral disgust serves a communicative function, implying that expressions of disgust serve to signal one's own moral intentions even when a different emotion is felt internally on the basis of appraisal.

Online social networks have become a ubiquitous medium for discussing moral and political ideas. Nevertheless, the field of moral psychology has yet to investigate why some moral and political ideas spread more widely than others. Using a large sample of social media communications concerning polarizing issues in public policy debates (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change), we found that the presence of moral-emotional language in political messages substantially increases their diffusion within (and less so between) ideological group boundaries. These findings offer insights into how moral ideas spread within networks during real political discussion. Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call \u201cmoral contagion.\u201d Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality.

Most humans around the world experience and express broadly similar emotional responses to significant events, such as bonding with others, prevailing over challenges, losing something or someone, or coping with threats to self or others. A rapidly expanding body of work illustrates that our emotions also reflect our cultural contexts. For example, a minor insult is more likely to trigger physiological and behavioral signs of rage among people from cultural contexts that emphasize honor concerns (eg, American South). Much of what we currently knowabout emotions is based on emotions of college students in North America and Western Europe, two sets of cultural contexts that are not representative of the world\u2019s diversity. Recently, researchers have been extending the study of emotions to people in cultural contexts with different models of emotions that are important, appropriate, desirable, and functional. There is much to gain from pursuing this work. In doing so, we may learn more about emotions, about culture, and about the interactions between the two, as well as examine practical questions that involve both constructs (eg, comparing people\u2019s responses to a political campaign).

The mortgage and housing crisis was an ongoing issue, and the BP oil spill was an ongoing event. As expected, the results suggest media as a predictor of Twitter for the two issue agendas studied. However, this study shows that the agenda-setting effects on Twitter are not equal in regard to issues and events. The agenda-setting effect of the media appeared to be stronger for the issue observed here. Moreover, initial evidence is provided that agendas for the ongoing events were more volatile than ongoing issues. For ongoing events, it appears that agendas are most reflective of the real-world cues that initiate them. This suggests that when real-world cues are largely absent, the media are less salient, and the agenda is more stable and ongoing. Finally, increased temporality appears to better reveal agenda-setting effects for events. Relaxed temporal measures appear to reveal the agenda-setting effect of ongoing issues more effectively. Events are not all equal; neither are issues. As such, the media and Twitter behave differently.

Among many, one of the fundamental questions is how to predict product adoption, and the answer to this question lays the foundation for product adoption maximization and demand estimation in large social networks. However, due to the inherent challenges resulting from the dynamic diffusion mechanism in online social networks, such as modeling of activation thresholds and influence probability, differentiating between influence and adoption, and incorporating review content, traditional diffusion models are often not adequate enough to predict product adoption accurately. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a linear threshold-hurdle model to predict product adoption incorporating social network effects. First, we present a fine-grained activation threshold model based on the five categories of adopters. In addition, we identify three operational factors underlying social network effects, including interaction strength, structural equivalence, and social entity similarity, to model influence probabilities. Furthermore, we distinguish influence spread from adoption spread by introducing a tattle state, in which users express opinions without adopting the product. Finally, we introduce the notion of hurdle to capture the monetary aspect in users' decision making process of product adoption. Based on the proposed linear threshold-hurdle model, two data mining methods based on the rough set technique, namely, decision rules and decomposition trees, are employed to predict product adoption in a large social network. An empirical study of Kindle Fire HD 7in. tablets is used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed model.

Why do some articles diffuse widely by prompting audience selections (attractability) and subsequent social retransmissions (virality), while others do not? Identifying what drives social epidemics of health news coverage is crucial to our understanding of its impact on the public, especially in the emerging media environment where news consumption has become increasingly selective and social. This dissertation examines how message features and social influence affect the volume and persistence of attractability and virality within the context of the online diffusion of New York Times (NYT) health news articles. The dissertation analyzes (1) behavioral data of audience selections and retransmissions of the NYT articles and (2) associated article content and context data that are collected using computational social science approaches (automated data mining; computer-assisted content analysis) along with more traditional methods (manual content analysis; message evaluation survey). Analyses of message effects on the total volume of attractability and virality show that articles with high informational utility and positive sentiment invite more frequent selections and retransmissions, and that articles are also more attractable when presenting controversial, emotionally evocative, and familiar content. Furthermore, these analyses reveal that informational utility and novelty have stronger positive associations with emailspecific virality, while emotion-related message features, content familiarity, and exemplification play a larger role in triggering social media-based retransmissions. Temporal dynamics analyses demonstrate social influence-driven cumulative advantage effects, such that articles which stay on popular-news lists longer invite more frequent subsequent selections and retransmissions. These analyses further show that the social influence effects are stronger for articles containing message features found to enhance the total volume of attractability and virality. This suggests that those synergistic interactions might underlie the observed message effects on total selections and retransmissions. Exploratory analyses reveal that the effects of social influence and message features tend to be similar for both (1) the volume of audience news selections and retransmissions and (2) the persistence of those behaviors. However, some message features, such as expressed emotionality, are relatively unique predictors of persistence outcomes. Results are discussed in light of their implications for communication research and practice.

We argue that these two developments were importantly linked and mutually energizing. We explain how a package of culturally evolved religious beliefs and practices characterized by increasingly potent, moralizing, supernatural agents, credible displays of faith, and other psychologically active elements conducive to social solidarity promoted high fertility rates and large-scale cooperation with co-religionists, often contributing to success in intergroup competition and conflict. In turn, prosocial religious beliefs and practices spread and aggregated as these successful groups expanded, or were copied by less successful groups. This synthesis is grounded in the idea that although religious beliefs and practices originally arose as nonadaptive by-products of innate cognitive functions, particular cultural variants were then selected for their prosocial effects in a long-term, cultural evolutionary process. This framework (1) reconciles key aspects of the adaptationist and by-product approaches to the origins of religion, (2) explains a variety of empirical observations that have not received adequate attention, and (3) generates novel predictions.

For this case, we first developed a more general mathematical model of cultural retention that takes into account the possibility of dependence of error rates between transmissions. In this model, under quite plausible assumptions, chains with two cultural parents will have superior retention of culture. This prediction was then tested in two experiments using both written and oral modes of transmission. In both cases, superior retention of culture was found in chains with two cultural parents.

Expanding on recent work that emphasizes the construction of reputations rather than their cultural content, we explore how forces in the organizational environment define organizational reputation.

Buttressing our theoretical claims with 30 interviews of business school administrators, we find that these mediators play a central role in determining organizational reputations by engaging in three processes of information manipulation: synthesis, selection, and simplification. In addition to specifying the key role that the manipulation of information by outsiders plays in the development of reputation, this approach suggests the importance of the interrelationships among these mediators in the determination of reputational standing.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 60, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "12243277", "name": "Michael Sauder"}, {"authorId": "27296239", "name": "G.

Despite the scientific rigor of the consumer behavior discipline, most scholars that have reviewed the field agree that it has yielded a fragmented and confused literature. It is argued here that this is in part due to the near paucity of evolutionary-based theorizing within the theoretical frameworks used by consumer scholars. While evolutionary psychology focuses on ultimate causation namely the adaptive origins of a particular cognition, emotion, preference, or behavior, the consumer behavior discipline has overwhelmingly addressed proximate mechanisms. Both levels of analyses are needed for a full understanding of consumption phenomena.

We argue that human emotions, triggered in algorithmic fashion through four common, although culturally specified, mechanisms, powerfully direct humans to compete or cooperate. Drawing on evolutionary psychology, we first define and characterize these hard-wired emotional algorithms, presenting evidence for their independent influence. Their regulatory influence on human groups, however, can only be appreciated once we examine them as a system. We show how, as a system, these algorithms help explain the dynamic balance that members of human groups can (and often must) achieve between competition and cooperation. We derive three propositions regarding how these algorithms play out in groups. We suggest that understanding these dynamics can help leaders better manage cooperation and competition in organizational groups.

Religion exploits only ordinary cognitive processes to passionately display costly devotion to counterintuitive worlds governed by supernatural agents. The conceptual foundations of religion are intuitively given by task-specific panhuman cognitive domains, including folkmechanics, folkbiology, and folkpsychology. Core religious beliefs minimally violate ordinary notions about how the world is, with all of its inescapable problems, thus enabling people to imagine minimally impossible supernatural worlds that solve existential problems, including death and deception. Here the focus is on folkpsychology and agency. A key feature of the supernatural agent concepts common to all religions is the triggering of an \u201cInnate Releasing Mechanism,\u201d or \u201cagency detector,\u201d whose proper (naturally selected) domain encompasses animate objects relevant to hominid survival \u2013 such as predators, protectors, and prey \u2013 but which actually extends to moving dots on computer screens, voices in wind, and faces on clouds. Folkpsychology also crucially involves metarepresentation, which makes deception possible and threatens any social order. However, these same metacognitive capacities provide the hope and promise of open-ended solutions through representations of counterfactual supernatural worlds that cannot be logically or empirically verified or falsified.

This tradition of cultural analysis of technology has followed Durkheim's lead (Durkheim, Emile 1965 [1915]. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Free Press, New York) in emphasizing the sacred while eliding its opposite, the profane. In this paper I contend that symbols of the profane continue to be powerful cultural elements that animate and order modern discourses and moral worlds, and that scholarly understanding of the culture of high technology can be enriched through analysis of profane symbols. I demonstrate this through metaphoric content analysis of the jargon of American high technology industry from the 1960s through the late 1990s, and show that (1) profane metaphors are widespread in high technology jargon as compared to the jargons of other occupations; (2) profane metaphors in high tech jargon have increased over the last three decades with the growth of high tech industry; and (3) these profane metaphors are thematically ordered, such that they tend to signify threats to technological progress, while technology itself is signified through morally benign metaphors. I argue that these metaphors have proliferated in high technology industry, and much less so in other occupations, because they buttress a moral worldview that makes technological innovations meaningful to their creators. For cultural analysis, these findings point to the value of examining metaphors sociologically, and of examining the social use of profane symbols in modern discourses in which the experience of the sacred is ambiguous or individualized.", "venue": "", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 20, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2013844", "name": "Gabe Ignatow"}]}}, {"contexts": ["Dion & Dion, 1993; Levine, Sato, Hashimoto, & Verma, 1995]; C."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "49242f6a8afc7b51b325d0fd8a9bc74c5d253e16", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2067763021", "DOI": "10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.451", "PubMed": "11439707"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49242f6a8afc7b51b325d0fd8a9bc74c5d253e16", "title": "Cultural variation: considerations and implications.", "abstract": "Cultural systems vary widely across the world.
