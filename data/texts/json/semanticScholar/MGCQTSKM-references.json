Cultural attributes most strongly correlated to group performance included those related to attitudes about organizational hierarchy, organizational harmony, trade-offs between future and current needs, and beliefs about how much influence individuals have on their fate. Moreover, the type of programming task affected the strength of the relationship between individual cultural attributes and performance. Participants in the study included computer science students from the University of North Texas (Texas, USA) and students from the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. Students were divided into culturally diverse work-teams and assigned programming projects to be completed using special collaborative software. The programming tasks ranged from simple design projects to more complicated programs that required extensive collaboration. Cultural distinctions between work-teams were based upon the students' responses to the CPQ. Project performance was evaluated with respect to programming accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and style.

Adult learning often seems more consistent with the sort of peer learning and exchange that takes place outside formal education and training situations than within them. When more and more adults, who have been away from schooling for a Dong time, need to develop their knowledge or skills, the demands for adult learning increase. Computer multimedia and networking is regarded as an ideal supporting technology to meet the increasing demands for continuing adult education, but may cause a drastic change in the style of adult learning. This technology may or may not suit the learners' characteristics and their prior learning style. Most important, this change provides a more complex learning environment. For example, Pinhey (1998) stated that the Internet made possible a global education curriculum with various nations involved, so that understanding and tolerance of cultural differences is needed to reach a successful learning outcome. Besides more intercultural communication, there also will be more interactions among learners of different age levels during the learning process. These further considerations are prompting researchers to explore the effect of these factors on adult learning outcomes. The Environment of the Case Study This study reports on the experiences of 18 adult learners who were participating in a 12-week credit course. Students learned how to use the computer and the Internet as learning aids. The course used a combination of face-to-face conventional instruction, group work and e-mail interaction. This compound learning style offered an ideal situation to compare learners' preference and the effect on learning between face-to-face and e-mail media. The participants came from various countries, including China, Fiji, Hong Kong, Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan and the United States. The mean age of the students was 38 years; the youngest was 24 while the oldest was 55. A total of 80 percent of the students had a personal computer in their home and 50 percent were able to access the Internet from home. One student was very sophisticated in IT (Information Technology) and more than half of them had more than three years of workplace computer experience. Through questionnaires, observations and interviews, we investigated the relationship between learner characteristics and their learning outcome, and the impact of the media used. We examined the learners' expectation of the teacher, the preferences by which these learners communicated with their learning peers, the conformity issue and the impact of the language barrier. Introvert vs. Extrovert Yi and Majima (1993) asserted that distance learning provided a low-anxiety learning environment and a relaxed atmosphere that lowered the learner's affective filter. Similarly, in this study, we found that the e-mail interactive learning style was more suitable for the introverts than face-to-face learning styles, because introverts may feel more comfortable in expressing themselves in e-mail interactive learning. The barriers of being embarrassed or being shy are partially removed. With more confidence, introverts are more comfortable in communicating with the tutors as well as the learning peers through e-mail interactive learning, but there is no evidence that such learning style is more efficient for introverts than for extroverts. In particular, even though the extroverts tend to prefer face-to-face interactive learning, this phenomenon can not be generalised to those learners who have a sophisticated IT background. After so many years working in front of the computer, the latter have become used to working/studying in front of the computer rather than working with co-learners face-to-face. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount": 58, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2057099911", "name": "Amy Liang"}, {"authorId": "1728867", "name": "R.

The results showed that while demographic diversity alone did have effects on strategic consensus the overall fit of the model was not strong. Adding two intervening group process variables, interpersonal conflict and agreement-seeking, to the model greatly improved the overall relationship with strategic consensus.

One of the technologies that shows great interest is Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs), which may be used in various applications, such as tele-education. This paper presents, analyzes and evaluates the basic elements of Elearn, a Collaborative Vi rtual Learning Environment (CVLE) that has been created for teaching electronic commerce. In Elearn, the virtual world, the web pages and the synchronous chat among the participants are integrated into the same environment. A user is represented as an avatar who can move, make gestures with its hands and head, bump into objects, pass through them, etc. A detailed list of navigation directions is provided in order to help the user to move freely into the environment. The possibility of many users to coexist in Elearn is also supported. Collaboration and cooperation are its two components that enhance the learning effectiveness. Collaboration is supported among students and teachers with the use of synchronous chat. The chat window appears on the screen along with the virtual world and the web pages, motivating the participants to use it. Asynchronous communication is also supported, via email and discussion board. The evaluation of a CVLE is an important and difficult task. Pedagogical issues, like conceptual learning, collaboration, constructivism and adaptability, should be taken under serious consideration. These parameters are crucial in achieving strong learning effectiveness. An evaluation table has been developed which includes all the important parameters concerning a CVLE. The evaluation is performed at four levels: 1) the pedagogical - psychological level, 2) the technical - functional level, 3) the organizational economical level, and 4) the social - cultural level. Elearn was used in an experiment supplementing traditional teaching. The students\u2019 participation was satisfactory, since they demonstrated great interest in exploring Elearn and using the synchronous chat capability. The basic pedagogical issues, like constructivism and collaboration, were fulfilled, but greater effort is needed towards the development of the lessons\u2019 content and exams. Students and teachers communicated via synchronous chat and email, as well as using the teacher\u2019s bot (an avatar that inhabits the virtual world and interacts with users).

Conventional teams exhibit group interaction styles that affect communication and thus team performance by facilitating or hindering the exchange of information among group members. In conventional teams, interaction style can be reliably assessed, and from that assessment, performance can be predicted. Here we present an overview of three studies that investigate human interaction and performance in the virtual setting. The first study presents the conversion of an instrument designed to assess interaction styles in face-to-face environments for use with virtual teams collaborating via the Internet. Results illustrate that interaction style predicts task performance outcomes (such as solution quality) and process outcomes (such as solution acceptance) in virtual teams in ways very similar to those seen in face-to-face teams. The second study offers a direct comparison of performance in virtual and face-to-face teams. Results show that virtual teams are less successful than face-to-face teams on most outcome measures. In addition, interaction styles explain much more variance of process outcomes than does communication mode. The third study examines the role of expertise and extraversion on interaction style and performance. Results indicate that extraversion begets a productive interaction style but that a difference in extraversion between team members leads to a negative style. We conclude with an integrative discussion and suggest additional avenues for this research. INTRODUCTION The prevailing perspective for research on virtual teams-particularly for IS researchers-is the linkage between communication technology attributes and usage, and team performance. This is so for both laboratory studies (e.g., Warkentin, et al., 1997; Ocker, et al., 1998; Tan, et al., 2000) and field studies (e.g, Maznevski and Chudoba, 2000). Conspicuously underrepresented as an independent variable in the IS literature on virtual teams is the quality of human interaction. We present a review of an empirical research stream that illustrates the critical and pervasive role that interaction plays in both the face-to-face (FTF) and the virtual context, how that interaction affects team performance on tasks that require information sharing, and how computer-based communication technologies affect the interaction dynamics and ultimately the team performance itself. Taken in sum, these studies create an important contextual perspective for virtual team, group support system (GSS), and computer-mediated communication (CMC) researchers: The effects of communication technology and its usage may be quite secondary to those that result from how the virtual group or team interacts. We begin with a more detailed description of relevant virtual team and allied research streams. Then we present the theoretical foundations of our work, a description of the research and findings to date, and conclude with some insights and suggestions for future research. DANCING AROUND THE OBVIOUS Anyone who has been assigned to work on a group or team project is immediately concerned with the quality of interaction they might enjoy with their teammates. Are these people easy to get along with? Are there some massive egos? Do we have extraverts who \"hog the bandwidth\" or passive folks who contribute little? Of course competency matters too, but not all competent people get along with each other, and friction can make teamwork a nightmare. Because of the relatively few prominent linkages between individual psychology and MIS, personality and group dynamics-- obvious drivers of team performance--have received little direct attention from IS researchers examining virtual teams. Personality and group interaction has, of course, been studied extensively in mainstream psychology, and some aspects have received the attention of CMC researchers. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 91, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2729354", "name": "Richard E.

As science continues to expand the boundaries of human knowledge, this disconnection is somewhat expected. However, if after going through the education system young generations do not acquire knowledge of the basic scientific concepts, the knowledge gap will continue to widen. Contrary, if young people are equipped with the underlying scientific principles, it is easier for them to stay connected with the growth of scientific knowledge throughout their lives (Richardson & Wolfe, 2001). Therefore, scientists should not only focus on research but also on bridging the gap between science and public knowledge of science by means of informal science education (Falk, ABSTRACT", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 16, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145127047", "name": "R.

It identifies the online course features and instructional goals selected as most important by a sample of 67 adults. It then compares this group\u2019s rankings with those of subgroups based on gender and preferred learning strategies as measured by the Assessing the Learning Strategies of Adults (ATLAS) test. The results of the study support the application of principles of adult learning in developing online environments for adults, identify some differences in learning emphasis by gender and preferred learning strategies, and underscore the importance of providing a variety of learning options in adult learning environments with an online component. Higher education is facing dramatic shifts in its demographics and its instructional delivery strategies. The new demographics of higher education identify part-time adult learners as the new majority, with nontraditional working adults now comprising more than 50% of the postsecondary student population and the fastest growing segment of the market (Cappelli, 2003; Levine, 2003; Shea, 2002; Symonds, 2003). One recent prediction estimated a 70% increase in over-35s in postsecondary education between 1985 and 2005 (Cappelli, 2003). According to recent data, over 75% of adults seeking higher education are employed while studying part-time (Cappelli, 2003), many are seeking further education to meet specific career goals (Shea, 2002; Symonds, 2003), and most have other pressing life concerns that make it difficult for them to commit to traditional class schedules (Levine, 2003). Given the busy and complex lifestyles of these adult learners, who are often referred to as nontraditional adult students, it is not surprising that they have shown a high degree of acceptance of, and even preference for, e-learning and at-distance study opportunities. Some educators have feared that surging emphasis on e-learning would disadvantage adults due to their lack of technology experience and reluctance to lose the familiarity and social benefits of classroom-based instruction (Ausburn, 2003). However, the reality is that many adults have clearly indicated the efficacy of e-learning in meeting their needs, and that the largest audience for online education today is nontraditional adults: working adults age 26 or older who study part-time, hold full-time jobs, and are unable to commit to rigid class schedules imposed by traditional classroom-based programs (Cappelli, 2003; Shea, 2002). A recent study by the Internet agency Education for Adults (2003) reinforced the emphasis by adults on the ability of education programs to fit into their busy lifestyles.

Research with learners from Confucian Heritage Culture, mainly from Singapore and Hong Kong, studying in their home country and as international students in Australia is used to establish the usefulness of the concept of socio-cultural appropriateness to understand transfer. The examples discussed reveal how some aspects of students learning travel extremely well and are congruent with the characteristics of learning valued in the host context, while others reflect ambivalent, difficult, or inappropriate transfer. The significance of mutual individual-context dynamic interactions, subjective nature of appropriateness, and emotional dimensions involved in transfer of learning is highlighted. Implications for educational practice in an international, multicultural perspective are outlined. \n \nThe literature on transfer of learning is replete with studies investigating the most effective ways to help learners transfer their knowledge and skills flexibly and appropriately across tasks and contexts. Overall, there is a general agreement that successful transfer of learning involves more than a cognitive match between the learner's mental baggage brought to the situation and the requirements of the transfer task or situation. The importance of the person-context mutual interactions, or the match between the individuals\u2019 effectivities and the affordances provided by the environment has been highlighted (Snow, 1994; Greeno, 1997). Recent transfer research has also stressed that attitudes (Resnick, 1987), dispositions (Bereiter, 1995), mindfulness (Salomon & Globerson, 1987), and motivation (McKeachie, 1987) are critical components of effective transfer alongside cognitive and metacognitive aspects. In addition to person characteristics, Boekaerts\u2019 (1997) research suggests that situation-specific cognitive, motivational and emotional appraisals of tasks and contexts also have a significant influence on learning and transfer. \n \nWithout necessarily downplaying the importance of learners\u2019 effectivities and situation-specific appraisals, recent situated cognition research (Brown, Collins & Duguid, 1989; Resnick, 1987; Rogoff, 1990; [Greeno, 1997] and [Greeno, 1998]) has emphasized the critical impact of affordances that learning contexts and activities provide to participants (Gruber, Law, Mandl & Renkl, 1995; Gibson, 1979/1986). It has been claimed that regardless of whether the focus is theory development, applied research, or improvement of educational practice, the unit of analysis must be the person-in-context or the whole activity setting. Although some situationists (e.g., Lave, 1988) have argued that transfer of knowledge may not exist since knowledge cannot be decontextualized, most theorists recognize that transfer of learning can be socially mediated and that guided forms of learning have potential for enhancing the likelihood of transferacross tasks and contexts. \n \nThis chapter examines the effectivities\u2013affordances interface in individuals\u2019 transfer of cognitions, motivations, and dispositions related to learningacross broad cultural-educational contexts.
