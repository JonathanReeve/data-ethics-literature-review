However, a recent series of criticisms have pointed to problematic aspects of mainstreaming AI systems in public administration, noting troubled outcomes in terms of justice and values. The argument supplied here is that any public administration adopting AI systems must consider and address ambiguities and uncertainties surrounding two key dimensions: the algorithms\u2019 results, and how public managers make decisions for and about AI systems\u2019 design. The article is based on bibliographic research in institutional theory perspective that relates the design of AI systems and relevant literature on the decision-making process in public policy. The main finding is to explain why autonomous decision systems continue to reproduce ambiguities and uncertainties when applied in public administration and propose a reflection on AI governance in public administration. This article points to the need for design institutions that immerse themselves in understanding the nuances, details, and potential outcomes of AI governance for public administration.

In the media industry, one of the technical advancements that often comes under the spotlight is automated journalism, a solution generally understood as the auto generation of journalistic stories through software and algorithms, without any human input except for the initial programming. Methods: In order to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical research on automated journalism, I analysed a range of variables that can account for the semantical, chronological and geographical features of a selection of academic articles as well as their research methods, theoretical backgrounds and fields of inquiry. I then engaged with and critically assessed the meta-data that I obtained to provide researchers with a good understanding of the main debates dominating the field. Results: My findings suggest that the expression \u201cautomated journalism\u201d should be called into question, that more attention should be devoted to non-English speaking scholarship, that the collective and individual impacts of the technology on media practitioners should be better documented and that well-established sociological theories such as institutionalism and Bourdieu\u2019s field theory could constitute two adequate frameworks to study automated journalism practices. Conclusions: This systematic literature therefore provides researchers with an overview of the main challenges and debates that are occurring within the field of automated journalism studies. Future studies should, in particular, make use of institutionalism and field theory to explore how automated journalism is impacting the work of media practitioners, which could help unearth common patterns across media organisations.

I propose a typology based on the relation to the process of work digitalisation. Further, I explain the linkages between various forms of digital work through the global exchange of tasks, materials and expertise resources. The typology serves as a heuristic tool for considering the broader implications of digitalisation for work and employment in terms of control and coordination as well as regulation and classification between linked workspaces, which I show using the example of the varieties of digital work needed to enable the use of smartphones.\n\u00a0KEYWORDS: Digital work; globalisation; virtual work; digitisation; Total Social Organisation of Labour", "venue": "Global Labour Journal", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 59, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2127943717", "name": "Esther Ruiz Ben"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "4105536795356d2606bbc695aaa0ace43bae91cb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3163876512", "DOI": "10.1080/17544750.2021.1915832"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4105536795356d2606bbc695aaa0ace43bae91cb", "title": "Friend or foe?

The media's capability to set the public agenda and create issues as a common core is a pivotal part of the public sphere and contributes fundamentally to society's cohesion. Algorithm-driven sources like social media that personalize content to the preferences of individuals and their social networks are considered agents of fragmentation of the public sphere. Politically extreme individuals relying on them may be particularly vulnerable to losing touch with society's common core. We employ an innovative operationalization of fragmentation on the individual level: \u201cissue horizons\u201d\u2014comprising issue diversity, top issue focus, and issue overlap\u2014to investigate how different information sources affect fragmentation. In a two-week daily diary, conducted 2016 in Germany, 356 participants named the two most important political issues of each day and reported the issue-specific sources of information. Results show that social media reliance neither increases nor decreases the compatibility of individuals' issue horizons, but news media reliance significantly increases the compatibility of issue horizons among the politically more extreme. Not relying on news media (but rather on social media) means that politically extreme persons are at risk of losing touch with society's mainstream. This attests to the news media's ongoing, indispensable integration function.

AI can reduce or increase information deficits of both citizens and decision-makers on the input, throughout, and output level of the political system. While the challenges that AI creates for democratic responsiveness and accountability have a novel technological dimension, they are nonetheless in continuity with existing transparency and accountability problems.

We examine how media bots can manipulate online ratings, change social perception of what is relevant and increase engagement with both on- and offline media entities. We extracted three types of data: (i) 530,942 tweets containing at least one URL from Globo Group or Folha Group collected via Twitter API; (ii) URL metadata from 158,690 articles by Globo Group and Folha Group; (iii) Twitter trending topics in Brazil. Profiles that posted links were later sampled and classified using the Botometer. Automated and human accounts were analyzed regarding their posting frequency and speed. In this paper, we assess the hypothesis that the existence of media bots is affecting the Twittersphere in Brazil, where automated accounts, empowered by AI, might be responsible for a substantial share of the links to popular Brazilian media outlets on Twitter. Our research provides quantitative empirical evidence that bots are particularly active in amplifying news media links in the initial moments of spreading. Additionally, automated accounts play an important role in promoting TV broadcast programs in Brazil. Based on these evidences, we discuss the strategies adopted by Brazilian media corporations to sustain their omnipresence online that boosts their online audience.

Prior research on candidate imagery has shown particular effects from non-verbal behavior (e.g., smiling), contextual features (e.g., the depiction of other people), and structural characteristics (e.g., camera angle and proximity). Importantly, this study argues to look at candidate imagery as institutionalized means of political communication online. In the realm of the European Parliamentary Election 2019, self-promoted candidate imagery on social networking sites (SNS) is expected to align cross-nationally along party-family structures vis-\u00e0-vis respective imagery in the news, which is anticipated to align along national borders. We analyze and describe respective candidate imagery in both news and SNS from 13,811 unique candidates across all 28 European member states by means of a computational content analysis of 79,500 images. After a manual two-step validation, which raises concerns about the validity of the computationally assigned camera angle, logistic regression models are used to estimate non-verbal behavior, contextual features, and structural characteristics. Findings show that while self-depiction on SNS includes more smiling, news imagery employs broader variation in camera angles and close-up photography. Differences are almost independent from structural influences with the exception of country alignment, which is a minor yet consistent predictor of all outcome variables. Visual computational content analysis has proven to be a useful and reliable utility for all but one variable \u2013 a call for its employment along strong validation also in future studies to allow visual content analyses also on a large and quantitative scale.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 87, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46693800", "name": "Mario Haim"}, {"authorId": "51296107", "name": "Marc Jungblut"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["The lock-in effect reflects the duality, a key characteristic of institutions that creates mutual reproduction between agents and structures (Napoli, 2014)."], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "c620d91cea6873851048021f8e12839029be06e4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3024752385", "DOI": "10.1177/1077699020916809"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c620d91cea6873851048021f8e12839029be06e4", "title": "Differentiation and De-differentiation: The Evolving Power Dynamics Between News Industry and Tech Industry", "abstract": "This essay proposes a new theoretical framework, the differentiation/de-differentiation framework, to help understand the evolving power dynamics between news industry and tech industry from institutional, relational, and dialectical perspectives.

As a unique modern counterculture, it stands in contravention of prevailing anthropological discourses that dominate conceptual frameworks. This has led to difficulty in constructing updated virtue epistemologies that result in veganism as a logical moral conclusion. It is clear that new social discourses need developing, and that this is a primary concern for affirming moral agency. To explain this and identify key issues and features, vegan communications are evaluated herein from a philosophical, psychological, and informational perspective, with a view of both historical and modern social contexts. In doing so, a number of novel theoretical reflections are offered. This is done through a discussion separated into four sections dealing first with a view of veganism in evolution, secondly with the social complexity of media trends and social positioning, thirdly with achieving constructive dialogue given present-day challenges, and finally with a discussion of modern information systems. Overall, this broad systems view of veganism in society leads to the conclusion that an up-to-date vegan communication theory must necessarily incorporate such diversity considerations, and must also generate a new discourse that is in line with the complex nature of social dynamics and individual development.

While the underlying, but often unquestioned, theoretical assumption in most communication research is that humans are communicators and machines are mediators, within HMC this assumption is challenged by asking what happens when a machine steps into this formerly human role. More than merely a semantic move, this theoretical reorientation opens up new questions about who or what constitutes a communicator, how social relationships are established through exchange among humans and machines, and what the resulting implications may be for self, society, and communication.

The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment.

These optimization metrics differ markedly from, for example, the so-called news factors journalists traditionally use to make editorial decisions. Social networks, video platforms and search engines thus create content hierarchies that reflect not only user interest but also their own monetization goals.

Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on government by improving the provision of essential social goods and services from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. The prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur. \nThis guide, written for department and delivery leads in the UK public sector and adopted by the British Government in its publication, 'Using AI in the Public Sector,' identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. It stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems. It also highlights the need for algorithmically supported outcomes to be interpretable by their users and made understandable to decision subjects in clear, non-technical, and accessible ways. Finally, it builds out a vision of human-centred and context-sensitive implementation that gives a central role to communication, evidence-based reasoning, situational awareness, and moral justifiability.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 346, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2061666356", "name": "David Leslie"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "af1330511bb4b7faa6f085f5d2b0b091dee9c426", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2996230953", "DOI": "10.1080/13183222.2019.1696600"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af1330511bb4b7faa6f085f5d2b0b091dee9c426", "title": "Nazaj v prihodnost: avtomatizacija in preobrazba novinarske epistemologije", "abstract": "Prispevek izhaja iz obravnav podrejanja novinarstva kapitalisti\u010dni nujnosti \u00bbracionalizacije\u00ab delovnega procesa s tehnolo\u0161kimi inovacijami.
