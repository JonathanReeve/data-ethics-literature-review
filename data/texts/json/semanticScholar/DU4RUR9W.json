Most digital inequality research focuses on digital consumption or participation, but this study uses a production lens to examine who is creating digital content for the public sphere. My results point to a class-based gap among producers of online content. A critical mechanism of this inequality is control of digital tools and an elite Internet-in-practice and information habitus to use the Internet. Using survey data of American adults, I apply a logit analysis of 10 production activities\u2014from Web sites and blogs to discussion forums and social media sites. Even among people who are already online, a digital production gap challenges theories that the Internet creates an egalitarian public sphere. Instead, digital production inequality suggests that elite voices still dominate in the new digital commons.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 73, "citationCount": 282, "influentialCitationCount": 22, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "114825930", "name": "J.
