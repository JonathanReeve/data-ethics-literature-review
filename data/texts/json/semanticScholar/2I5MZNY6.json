The mechanisms and conditions under which search results are selected should therefore be of considerable interest to media scholars, political theorists, and citizens alike. In this chapter, I adopt a \u201cdeliberative\u201d ideal for search engines and examine whether Google exhibits the \u201csame old\u201d media biases of mainstreaming, hypercommercialism, and industry consolidation. In the end, serious objections to Google are raised: Google may favor popularity over richness; it provides advertising that competes directly with \u201ceditorial\u201d content; it so overwhelmingly dominates the industry that users seldom get a second opinion, and this is unlikely to change. Ultimately, however, the results of this analysis may speak less about Google than about contradictions in the deliberative ideal and the so-called \u201cinherently democratic\u201d nature of the Web.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 109, "citationCount": 81, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144774413", "name": "A.
