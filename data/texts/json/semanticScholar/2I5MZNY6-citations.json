These extensions can extract pairwise correspondences between images from trained black-box models. We also introduce a fast kernel-based method for estimating Shapley-Taylor indices that require orders of magnitude fewer function evaluations to converge.

The purpose of this literature review is to revisit these ideas in the light of recent events in global information systems that demonstrate that their fears were justified.Design/methodology/approachThe authors revisit the theory in information science that Belkin and Robertson used to build their argument, together with the discussion on ethics that resulted from this work in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Indeed, the politics and power which lurk behind these technologies are often obscured, or normalised, by their ubiquity and aesthetics, a process which, following Benjamin, can perhaps only be exposed by the repoliticisation of language through art.

For example, web search results are presented as a ranking of relevant websites, and online bookstores often show us lists of best-selling books. While popularity-based ranking algorithms (like Google\u2019s PageRank) have been extensively studied in previous works, we still lack a clear understanding of their potential systemic consequences. In this work, we fill this gap by introducing a new model of network growth that allows us to compare the properties of networks generated under the influence of different ranking algorithms. We show that by correcting for the omnipresent age bias of popularity-based ranking algorithms, the resulting networks exhibit a significantly larger agreement between the nodes\u2019 inherent quality and their long-term popularity, and a less concentrated popularity distribution. To further promote popularity diversity, we introduce and validate a perturbation of the original rankings where a small number of randomly-selected nodes are promoted to the top of the ranking. Our findings move the first steps toward a model-based understanding of the long-term impact of popularity-based ranking algorithms, and our novel framework could be used to design improved information filtering tools.", "venue": "Inf.

Gold Software of the Oppressed is a critical analysis of software practices within the university and the ways they contribute to a broader status quo of software use, development, and imagination. Through analyzing the history of software practices used in the production and circulation of student and scholarly writing, I argue that this overarching software status quo has oppressive qualities in that it supports the production of passive users, or users who are unable to collectively understand and transform software code for their own interests. I also argue that the university inadvertently normalizes and strengthens the software status quo through what I call its \u201cinvisible discipline,\u201d or the conditioning of its community\u2014particularly students, but also faculty, librarians, staff, and other university members\u2014to have little expectation of being able to participate in the governance or development of the software used in their academic settings. This invisible discipline not only fails to prepare students for the political struggles and practical needs of our digital age (while increasing the social divide between those who program digital technology and those who must passively accept it), but reinforces a lack of awareness of how digital technology powerfully mediates the production, circulation, and reception of knowledge at individual and collective levels. Through this analysis, I hope to show what a liberatory approach to academic technology practices might look like, as well as demonstrate\u2014through a variety of alternative software practices in and beyond the university\u2014the intellectual, political, and social contributions these practices might contribute to higher education and scholarly knowledge production at large.

The authors argue that the search engine results page (SERP) exposes three important types of bias: source bias, algorithmic bias, and cognitive bias. To explore the relationship between these three types of bias, we conducted a mixed methods study with sixty participants (plus fourteen in a pilot to make a total of seventy-four participants). Within a library setting, participants were provided with mock search engine pages that presented order-controlled sources on a science controversy. Participants were then asked to rank the sources' usefulness and then summarize the controversy. We found that participants ranked the usefulness of sources depending on its presentation within a SERP. In turn, this also influenced how the participants summarized the topic. We attribute the differences in the participants' writings to the cognitive biases that affect a user's judgment when selecting sources on a SERP. We identify four main cognitive biases that a SERP can evoke in students: Priming, Anchoring, Framing, and the Availability Heuristic. While policing information quality is a quixotic task, changes can be made to both SERPs and a user's decision-making when selecting sources.

The uptake and adoption of emerging technologies, including those allowing the acquisition and distribution of images, are becoming more widespread, including within anatomical science education. Images of cadavers are useful for research and education, and their supply and distribution have commercial potential for textbooks and online education. It is unclear whether the utilization of images of donated cadavers are congruent with donor expectations, societal norms and boundaries of established public understanding. Presently, no global \u201cbest practices\u201d or standards exist, nor is there a common model requiring specific image\u2010related consent from body donors. As ongoing success of body donation programs relies upon the ethical and institutional governance of body utilization to maintain trust and a positive relationship with potential donors and the community, discussions considering the potential impact of image misuse are important. This paper discusses the subject of images of donated cadavers, commenting on images in non\u2010specific use, education, research, and commercial applications. It explores the role and significance of such images in the context of anatomical science and society, and discusses how misuse \u2010 including unconsented use \u2010 of images has the potential to affect donor program success, suggesting that informed consent is currently necessary for all images arising from donated cadavers.

The investigation of conversation from across the internet required a very large scale approach, situating the study within the big data paradigm.

Therefore the study utilised a novel, iterative, quali-quanti approach featuring initial, large scale quantitative analysis \u2013 involving bespoke software to automate the collection and analysis of conversation data \u2013 that was used to direct further iterations of increasingly smaller scale and qualitative analysis. Reflections on the successful application of the methodology are significant in themselves, but the study also generated novel observations of online public political conversation. The findings illustrated participatory spaces as unique online niches, each with specific communities and goals, and described how participant agency allows citizens to contribute according to various democratic models. For example, an action-oriented approach existed in policy related spaces, in which participants sought only to express a preference, rather than engage in discussion. In more discursive spaces, non-political social bonds between participants were seen to be particularly important in the facilitation of civil, productive, inter-ideological debate and certain participatory roles were important in facilitating these bonds. The design of spaces exerted a significant, but not determining effect on conversation, being used to present conversation in particular ways.

Examples are drawn from a wide range of settings, including ethnographies of scientific institutions, television, social media and locally based gift-giving networks. - See more at: http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/ethnography-for-the-internet-9780857855701/#sthash.6wmdZKzF.dpuf", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 290, "citationCount": 305, "influentialCitationCount": 23, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145202971", "name": "C.

This model is challenged by modern search engines and information retrieval (IR) researchers, who often consider Boolean retrieval a less efficient approach. The paper examines this claim and argues for the continued value of Boolean systems, and suggests two further considerations: (a) the important role of human expertise in searching (expert searchers and \u201cinformation literate\u201d users) and (b) the role of library and information science and knowledge organization (KO) in the design and use of classical databases. An underlying issue is the kind of retrieval system for which one should aim. Warner's (2010) differentiation between the computer science traditions and an older library\u2010oriented tradition seems important; the former aim to transform queries automatically into (ranked) sets of relevant documents, whereas the latter aims to increase the \u201cselection power\u201d of users. The Boolean retrieval model is valuable in providing users with the power to make informed searches and have full control over what is found and what is not.

A major part of this growing body of information is digital image and video. The task of automated image retrieval is complicated by the fact that many images do not have adequate textual descriptions. Retrieval of images through the analysis of their visual content is therefore an exciting and a worthwhile research challenge. In this thesis, emphasize have been given to the different image representation technique using various recently developed Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) tools like curvelet transform, ripplet transform and many more. An extensive investigation has been performed to find out a proper combination of MRA feature extraction tool and the suitable classifier in order to generate compact feature vector for an efficient representation of different image class. It has been shown that a compact image feature representation plays an important role in order to obtain the high accuracy of retrieval results. However, in spite of the compact representation of the image, still there exists a semantic gap between the actual visual meaning of an image and its low level representation in terms of feature vectors. To overcome this problem, fuzzy and graph based relevance feedback mechanism have been proposed in this thesis. Finally, two image retrieval systems in real life application have been designed. In this regard, radiographic and endoscopic based image retrieval system is proposed. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art schemes are carried out to qualitatively as well as quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes.

The research questions at the centre of this study are what motivates African Caribbean people in the UK to become bloggers; what gratification they experience through authoring blogs; how they use blogs to address issues of representation in the mainstream media and their perceptions of the social impact of their activities as bloggers. The findings reveal that motivation for blogging is linked to voice, visibility and empowerment and gratification is linked to voice, knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition and social interaction. While voice, as a motivational factor and gratification for some participants is linked to interests in creative writing and journalism, for many others motivation and gratification are driven by a complex set of factors linked to issues of race and representation. These stem from feelings of being voiceless, invisible and marginalised as African Caribbean people in British society and blogs function as an assertive strategy and medium for self-representation. The constructed narratives of the bloggers who participated in this study reveal their experience of subtle forms of prejudice and discrimination perpetuated through dominant discourses in the mainstream media and marginalisation in the wider society. The findings demonstrate that race and ethnicity are inextricably linked to motivation and gratification and influence blogging practice and content production.

However, even when afforded such an apparently instrumental role, several important elements of the Internet are based on, and oriented towards, culture, identity and collectivity, and relate to a symbolically un-fragmented system that remains largely unconscious. In this paper we appropriate the concept of ontological security to explore the autonomy of the cultural dimension of online search, which has gone largely unanalysed in the literature. Ontological security is the unconscious sense that individuals have about the continuity and order in events related to their lives. At the collective level, it relates to the stability of the symbolic structures of society, which are both inclusive and exclusionary. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative empirical exercises, we show that search engines (1) construct ontological meaning as much as they provide utility, (2) relate to unconscious individuation even more strongly than rational instrumentality and (3) help in dealing with existential questions about the informational chaos of reality generated during the realization of global events.

This issue assumes particular relevance at a time in which, amidst the worst economic crisis in decades, the rights of those traditionally excluded from civic life are at risk of being compromised even further. In an effort to transcend the restrictive access/accessibility framework applied so far in disability and new media research, this project focused on the \u201cdigitalisation\u201d of disability activism in the wake of the radical welfare reform introduced by the UK government between 2010 and 2012. A combination of emerging digital methods and established social science techniques were employed to map and analyse the groups involved in opposing proposed changes to disability welfare online. These included: hyperlink network analysis; an \u201cinventory\u201d of online media; content analysis of Facebook conversations; and semi-structured interviews with key figures from a variety of campaigning groups. \n \nOverall, this work exposed an evolution in the ecology of British disability activism involving both changes in the way in which existing organisations operate as well as the emergence of new, online-based players. In particular, three main group types were identified. These included: formal disability organisations (both \u201cprofessionalised\u201d charities and member-led groups); experienced disabled activists who experimented with e-campaigning for the first time; and a network of young disabled bloggers-turned-activists who operated exclusively online and rapidly gained visibility on both the internet and traditional mass media (i.e. print and broadcast). Each of these phenomena was explored in detail through the analysis of three emblematic case studies (The Hardest Hit; Disabled People Against Cuts; The Broken of Britain). Several findings emerged that invited reflections on both the changing nature of disability activism in the digital age and the significance of the internet as a civic resource for disadvantaged groups more broadly. To assess the influence of contextual factors on these trends, the online experience of British formal disability organisations was compared to that of their American counterparts, which in the same period were opposing proposals for drastic cuts to federal Medicaid funding. \n \nIn Britain, established players were found to be blending traditional repertoires with participatory online tools in a bid to \u201csurvive\u201d the pressure of changing user-expectations and the fast pace of contemporary politics. Meanwhile, a new generation of self-appointed disabled \u201cleaders\u201d used online media to construct a radically different form of disability activism. This was focused more on issues than ideology, aspiring to redesigning protest in a less contentious and arguably more effective fashion. Nevertheless, the high centralisation and rigid leadership style adopted by these very same campaigners also cast doubts on their ability to promote a more inclusive campaigning experience for online supporters, whose involvement ultimately constituted a form of \u201cpeer-mediated\u201d citizenship rather than direct empowerment. At the same time, the comparative part of this study captured a counter-intuitive picture for which British formal disability organisations were ahead of their American counterparts in terms of online innovation. This generated some important reflections on the very nature of \u201ccontext\u201d in online politics with particular reference to the relationship between systemic and circumstantial factors, as well as the importance of acute crisis moments as triggers of progress in e-activism.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 399, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "36681183", "name": "F.

In 2010, Google accounted on average for 85.07% of all worldwide searches, Yahoo for 6.12%, Baidu for 3.33%, Bing for 3.25%, Ask for 0.67% and others for 1.56% (January-December 2010, http://marketshare.hitslink.com/search-engine-marketshare.aspx?qprid=5).

Google has become ubiquitous in everyday life \u2013 it is shaping how we search, organize and perceive information in contexts like the workplace, private life, culture, politics, the household, shopping and consumption, entertainment, sports, etc. The phrase \u201cto google\u201d has even found its way into the vocabulary of some languages. The Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201cto google\u201d as \u201csearch for information about (someone or something) on the Internet, typically using the search engine Google\u201d and remarks that the word\u2019s origin is \u201cthe proprietary name of a popular Internet search engine\u201d (http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0342960#m_en_gb0342960, accessed on February 10, 2011). The German Duden (2009 edition) defines the term \u201cgoogeln\u201d as \u201cim Internet suchen\u201d (p. 498, = to search on the Internet). The circumstance that a company name becomes part of a vocabulary indicates that the products of large monopoly capitalist companies have become so present in capitalist society that their existence is absolutely taken for granted, not questioned and so strongly fetishized that specific verbs (\u201cto google\u201d, \u201cgoogeln\u201d) are defined for expressing the usage of these products. There are a lot of affirmative, uncritical popular scienceand business studiespublications about Google that have a celebratory tone, take for granted economic power and do not see this kind of power\u2019s underbelly. For example, David Vise (2005) tells the Google Story in a celebratory tone. He argues that the great thing about Google is that it helps people \u201cto find the information\u201d (Vise 2005:292) they need and that it \u201creliably provides free information for everyone who seeks it\u201d (Vise 2005:2). Tapscott and Williams invoke the images of revolution and participatory democracy when speaking about web 2.0 companies and therefore characterize Google as providing \u201cparticipatory Web services\u201d (Tapscott and Williams 2006:193). Bernard Girard (2009) says that Google has \u201cdemocratized advertising\u201d (Girard 2009:39) and \u201crepresents the invention of a new management model \u2013 and calling it revolutionary is no exaggeration\u201d (Girard 2009:223). Jeff Jarvis says that talking about Google means \u201ctalking about a new society\u201d that is built on \u201cconnections, links, transparency, openness, publicness, listening, trust, wisdom, generosity, efficiency, markets, niches, platforms, networks, speed, and abundance\u201d (Jarvis 2009:240f). Books such as the Google Story (Vise 2005), What would Google do? (Jarvis 2009), The Google way (Girard 2009), or Googled (Auletta 2010) not only celebrate Google, but at the same time advance the individualistic myth of the American dream, in which hard working individuals have great ideas and thereby become successful.

How to protect privacy online is a frequent question in public discourse and has reignited the interest of government actors. In the United States, notice-and-consent remains the fallback approach in online privacy policies, despite its weaknesses. This essay presents an alternative approach, rooted in the theory of contextual integrity. Proposals to improve and fortify notice-and-consent, such as clearer privacy policies and fairer information practices, will not overcome a fundamental flaw in the model, namely, its assumption that individuals can understand all facts relevant to true choice at the moment of pair-wise contracting between individuals and data gatherers. Instead, we must articulate a backdrop of context-specific substantive norms that constrain what information websites can collect, with whom they can share it, and under what conditions it can be shared. In developing this approach, the paper warns that the current bias in conceiving of the Net as a predominantly commercial enterprise seriously limits the privacy agenda.", "venue": "Daedalus", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 432, "influentialCitationCount": 26, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2994505", "name": "H.

While intended to enhance intellectual mobility in the online sphere, this chapter reveals that the quest for the perfect search engine requires the widespread monitoring and aggregation of a users\u2019 online personal and intellectual activities, threatening the values the perfect search engines were designed to sustain. It argues that these search-based infrastructures of dataveillance contribute to a rapidly emerging \u201csoft cage\u201d of everyday digital surveillance, where they, like other dataveillance technologies before them, contribute to the curtailing of individual freedom, affect users\u2019 sense of self, and present issues of deep discrimination and social justice.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 45, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145416457", "name": "M.

Cette theorie a ete developpee dans le monde de l'information documentaire par Ranganathan (1933, 1967). L'auteur propose de decrire le contenu des documents selon une approche combinatoire et multidimensionnelle qui s'oppose aux classifications mono hierarchiques en vigueur jusque la. Pour Ranganathan, le contenu de tout document touche a cinq aspects de la realite : la Personnalite, la matiere, l'energie, l'espace et le Temps. A ces cinq perspectives s'ajoute une facette principale, representant generalement le domaine de la connaissance auquel on peut rattacher un document particulier (Agriculture, Medecine, etc.). Nous proposons dans ce travail de reinterroger la theorie des facettes de Ranganathan dans une perspective de recherche d'information sur internet. Nous nous interrogerons sur la faisabilite et la mise en oeuvre de telles descriptions pour les documents en ligne. La caracterisation des facettes passe par un travail multidisciplinaire mettant en \u0153uvre des emprunts et des transpositions dans le domaine de la fouille de donnees, de la psychologie sociale, de l'informatique, des mathematiques, des sciences du langage, de la communication.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 198, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38543915", "name": "\u00c9.
