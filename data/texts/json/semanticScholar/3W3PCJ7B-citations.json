Financial Infrastructure and Optimal Policy", "abstract": "In response to the Covid-19 crisis, 186 countries implemented direct cash transfers to households, and 181 introduced in-kind programs that lowered the cost of utilities such as electricity, water, transport, and mobile money. Do cash or in-kind transfers generate greater welfare improvements? And, does a country\u2019s financial infrastructure affect optimal aid disbursement? Through a parallel set of surveys in two urban regions in Africa\u2014with comparable education, cell phone ownership, and electricity connectivity\u2014we show that optimal government aid disbursement hinges on financial infrastructure. In line with economic theory favoring direct cash transfers, in a randomized experiment in Kenya 95% of urban recipients prefer mobile money over electricity transfers of a similar monetary value. But Kenya is an outlier with high mobile money adoption: this increases its value and reduces transaction costs of buying electricity credit. By contrast, in Ghana\u2014where mobile money is less widespread and the transaction costs for buying electricity are higher\u2014half of recipients prefer electricity transfers, and many are willing to forego significant value to receive electricity instead of mobile money. These results have several important policy implications. First, the optimal government policy in response to an economic crisis is not uniform: cash and in-kind transfers have different advantages that make each suitable for specific contexts. Second, the adoption of modern financial technologies will likely increase the efficiency of government cash transfer programs, even as in-kind transfers continue to be preferred in settings where mobile money uptake is slow.

First, we update prior meta-analyses of studies of the impacts of BWCs on policing outcomes to incorporate the most recent, and largest, studies carried out to date in this literature. This additional information provides additional support for the idea that cameras may affect a number of policing outcomes that are important from a social welfare perspective, particularly police use of force. Second, we carry out a benefit-cost analysis of BWCs, as financial barriers are often cited as a key impediment to adoption by police departments. Our baseline estimate for the benefit-cost ratio of BWCs is 4.95. Perhaps as much as one-quarter of the estimated benefits accrue to government budgets directly, which suggests the possibility that this technology could, from the narrow perspective of government budgets, even pay for itself.<br><br>Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/&#119;28622\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.nber.org</a>.<br>", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115927206", "name": "Morgan Williams"}, {"authorId": "2100543410", "name": "Nathan Weil"}, {"authorId": "2100542292", "name": "Elizabeth Rasich"}, {"authorId": "91805033", "name": "J.

However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China\u2019s policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find three main results. First, more than 80% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality\u2019s economic development, and much of this can be attributed to misaligned incentives across political hierarchies. Second, local politicians allocate more resources to ensure the experiments\u2019 success, and such effort is not replicable when policies roll out to the entire country. Third, the presence of sample selection and strategic effort is not fully accounted for by the central government, thus affecting policy learning and distorting national policies originating from the experimentation. Taken together, these results suggest that while China\u2019s bureaucratic and institutional conditions make policy experimentation at such scale possible, the complex political environments can also limit the scope and bias the direction of policy learning. *.

Scientists have proposed many scalable interventions to support students learning online. In one of the largest international field experiments in education, we iteratively tested established behavioral science interventions and found small benefits depending on individual and contextual characteristics. Forecasting intervention efficacy using state-of-the-art methods yields limited improvements. Online education provides unprecedented access to learning opportunities, as evidenced by its role during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, but adequately supporting diverse students will require more than a light-touch intervention. Our findings encourage funding agencies and researchers conducting large-scale field trials to consider dynamic investigations to uncover and design for contextual heterogeneity to complement static investigations of overall effects. Online education is rapidly expanding in response to rising demand for higher and continuing education, but many online students struggle to achieve their educational goals. Several behavioral science interventions have shown promise in raising student persistence and completion rates in a handful of courses, but evidence of their effectiveness across diverse educational contexts is limited. In this study, we test a set of established interventions over 2.5 y, with one-quarter million students, from nearly every country, across 247 online courses offered by Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford. We hypothesized that the interventions would produce medium-to-large effects as in prior studies, but this is not supported by our results. Instead, using an iterative scientific process of cyclically preregistering new hypotheses in between waves of data collection, we identified individual, contextual, and temporal conditions under which the interventions benefit students. Self-regulation interventions raised student engagement in the first few weeks but not final completion rates. Value-relevance interventions raised completion rates in developing countries to close the global achievement gap, but only in courses with a global gap. We found minimal evidence that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can forecast the occurrence of a global gap or learn effective individualized intervention policies. Scaling behavioral science interventions across various online learning contexts can reduce their average effectiveness by an order-of-magnitude.

GIPT allows for heterogeneous ATE estimates that vary by geographic location, and can utilize a large proportion of the sample in estimating the ATE at each target point. Small sample properties demonstrate that the ATE surface is smooth with GIPT. Our Monte Carlo simulations validate the strong small sample performance of GIPT.

Some of the most influential contributions of the discipline in an applied setting have centered around the development of norm-based interventions. The success that these interventions have had in specific contexts presents an opportunity to utilize them as tools for tackling a prevalent type of poverty at the EU level: energy poverty. Recent contributions to the literature highlight the role of inefficient energy behavior as a significant driver of this particular type of poverty, which is characterized by an inability to afford the basic energy services necessary to guarantee a decent standard of living. Therefore, the effectiveness of norm-based interventions in vulnerable populations merits further investigation to determine whether this approach can suitably address the behavioral components of energy poverty by promoting efficient energy consumption and conservation efforts. This is particularly imperative when combined with retrofitting innovations, as it can help avoid negative behavioral responses often associated with the implementation of efficiency upgrades, such as rebound effects. \n \nThis study reports on a pilot conducted in an exemplary social housing context (located in Bolzano, Italy) with the aim to assess the effectiveness of social comparison interventions in energy vulnerable groups. Using a design that combines appeals to injunctive and descriptive norms embedded within In-Home Devices (IHD) in recently retrofitted homes, our objective is to set a basis for the assessment of effectiveness of these types of interventions in social housing populations.

Social scientists frequently invoke external validity as an ideal, but they rarely attempt to make rigorous, credible external validity inferences. In recent years, methodologically-oriented scholars have advanced a flurry of work on various components of external validity, and this article reviews and systematizes many of those insights. We first clarify the core conceptual dimensions of external validity and introduce a simple formalization that demonstrates why external validity matters so critically. We then organize disparate arguments about how to address external validity by advancing three evaluative criteria: Model Utility, Scope Plausibility, and Specification Credibility. We conclude with a practical aspiration that scholars supplement existing reporting standards to include routine discussion of external validity. It is our hope that these evaluation and reporting standards help re-balance scientific inquiry, such that the current obsession with causal inference is complemented with an equal interest in generalized knowledge. \u2217For helpful research assistance, we thank Megan Farrell, Klara Fredriksson, Kai Yue (Theodore) Charm, Juan Lozano, Amila Lulo, Xin Nong, Ayu Sofyan, Aditya Tantravahi, and Alex Wais, as well as Vanessa Gonzalez, Jonah Isaac, Samiya Javed, Sara Lowe, and Jenny Rodriguez.

We consider five potential channels for this gap: statistical power, selective publication, academic involvement, differences in trial features and in nudge features. Publication bias in the academic journals, exacerbated by low statistical power, can account for the full difference in effect sizes. Academic involvement does not account for the difference. Different features of the nudges, such as in-person versus letter-based communication, likely reflecting institutional constraints, can partially explain the different effect sizes. We conjecture that larger sample sizes and institutional constraints, which play an important role in our setting, are relevant in other at-scale implementations.

In recent years, an increasing share of clinical trials have been funded by pharmaceutical firms, as opposed to by the public sector. This paper estimates the effect of financial sponsorship on reported drug efficacy, leveraging the insight that the exact same sets of drugs are often compared in different randomized control trials conducted by parties with different financial interests. In principle, randomized control trials comparing the same drugs should yield comparable estimates, regardless of the interests of the trial\u2019s funders. In practice, I use newly assembled data on hundreds of psychiatric clinical trials to estimate that a drug appears 0.15 standard deviations more effective when the trial is sponsored by that drug\u2019s manufacturer, compared with the same drug in the same trial without the drug manufacturer\u2019s involvement. Observable characteristics of trial design and patient enrollment explain little of this effect. In contrast, sponsored papers with non-positive results are more likely to remain unpublished. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest this publication mechanism can account for nearly half of the sponsorship effect. The sponsorship effect decreases over time as pre-registration requirements were implemented, which is suggestive, though not definitive, that pre-registration may be effective in overcoming sponsorship bias. \u2217I am very grateful to Amy Finkelstein, Heidi Williams, and Jim Poterba for their invaluable advice and guidance.

Applications of this technique often measure the impact of an intervention on a self-selected sample. In this paper, I propose that social pressure from the experimenter is a determinant of these selection decisions. I test this hypothesis in the context of a study on a free LED lighting program. Recruitment takes place door-to-door in the suburbs of Chicago. A day before their recruitment visit, each household is informed about the study with a flyer on their doorknob. I isolate the role of social pressure by varying whether households can select out of the study by checking an opt-out box on their flyer. My main finding is that the LED lighting program causes a 15 percent reduction in evening energy use in the sample recruited with an opt-out flyer, whereas no energy savings are observed amongst households recruited with a baseline flyer. Social pressure appears to be the driver of these disparate effects, as the opt-out flyer causes a 13 percent reduction in households answering their door and, conditional on answering, causes a 52 percent increase in selection into the study. These results have important implications for the way evaluation experiments with self-selected samples are conducted, reported, and modeled. \u2217I thank Leonardo Bursztyn, Steven Levitt, and, John List for their support with this project.

In removing inefficiencies in production, many argue, a circular economy is beneficial not only for the environment, but also for the economy at large. However, there are still many barriers to overcome to move to a true circular economy. Among other things, because the circular economy concept stems from the engineering and economics literature, there has been much focus on the role of technology, governments and corporations in setting up and transitioning to circular economy policies and infrastructure. However, the human behavior aspect of the circular economy is often left out. In this paper, we categorize key barriers to individual recycling and propose promising solutions to motivate recycling based on behavioral science.

Although more than 40 pre-treatment covariates are available in the experiment, only 8 of them were also measured in a target population. To tackle this common issue of data constraints, we propose a method to estimate a separating set -- a set of variables affecting both the sampling mechanism and treatment effect heterogeneity -- and show that the population average treatment effect (PATE) can be identified by adjusting for estimated separating sets. Our approach has two advantages. First, our algorithm only requires a rich set of covariates in the experimental data, not in the target population. Second, the algorithm can estimate separating sets under researcher-specific constraints on what variables are measured in the population.

We use rank-order correlation across the treatments as measure of stability, and compare the observed correlation to the one under a benchmark of full stability (which allows for noise), and to expert forecasts.

We find near perfect replication of the experimental results, and full stability of the results across demographics, significantly higher than the experts expected. The results are quite different across task and output change, mostly because the task change adds noise to the findings. The results are also stable to the lack of consent.

However, there were immediate signs of differential program behavior in their case: for example, of the 127 facilities they study, spread across two districts, five immediately quit the study following a lightning strike in one district while only one facility left the study in the other district. We saw no such obvious outward sign of differential program reception: none of the 140 facilities dropped out of our study in either state. Our analysis found that the reason for the heterogeneous effects between the two states is not explained by facility-level variables of the kind usually collected in field surveys, including measures of human capital and facility-level productivity. Explaining heterogeneity and assessing external validity of social recognition interventions may require the collection of new kinds of data both at the individual staff level (e.g., social preferences, time discounting) and at the firm/ministry level (e.g., institutional or professional incentives including career dynamics, supervision structures, accountability).

Tests of seven highly cited social psychological phenomena (two involving opinion change resulting from social influence and five involving the use of heuristics in social judgments) using data collected from randomly sampled, representative groups of American adults documented generalizability of the six phenomena that have been replicated previously with undergraduate samples. The 1 phenomenon (a cross-over interaction revealing an ease of retrieval effect) that has not been replicated successfully previously in undergraduate samples was also not observed here. However, the observed effect sizes for the replicated phenomena were notably smaller on average than the meta-analytic effect sizes documented by past studies of college students. Furthermore, the phenomena were strongest among participants with the demographic characteristics of the college students who typically provided data for past published studies, even after correcting for publication bias in past studies using a new method, called the behaviorally-informed file-drawer adjustment. The six successful replications suggest that phenomena identified in traditional laboratory research also appear as expected in representative samples but more weakly, so observed effect sizes should be generalized with caution.

We use rank-order correlation across the treatments as measure of stability, and compare the observed correlation to the one under a benchmark of full stability (which allows for noise), and to expert forecasts.

We find near perfect replication of the experimental results, and full stability of the results across demographics, significantly higher than the experts expected. The results are quite different across task and output change, mostly because the task change adds noise to the findings. The results are also stable to the lack of consent.

To illustrate these difficulties we apply the generalized synthetic control method to evaluate the introduction of a British national minimum wage. We find a short-term decreasing effect on youth unemployment that turns into an increasing effect over time. This suggests the presence of an upward biased selection effect from strategic timing.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the project's impact, target attainment, and on-site spending.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this endline evaluation of the MVP, we retrospectively selected comparison villages that best matched the project villages on possible confounding variables. Cross-sectional survey data on 40 outcomes of interest were collected from both the project and the comparison villages in 2015. Using these data, as well as on-site spending data collected during the project, we estimated project impacts as differences in outcomes between the project and comparison villages; target attainment as differences between project outcomes and prespecified targets; and on-site spending as expenditures reported by communities, donors, governments, and the project. Spending data were not collected in the comparison villages.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nAveraged across the ten project sites, we found that impact estimates for 30 of 40 outcomes were significant (95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] for these outcomes excluded zero) and favoured the project villages. In particular, substantial effects were seen in agriculture and health, in which some outcomes were roughly one SD better in the project villages than in the comparison villages. The project was estimated to have no significant impact on the consumption-based measures of poverty, but a significant favourable impact on an index of asset ownership. Impacts on nutrition and education outcomes were often inconclusive (95% UIs included zero). Averaging across outcomes within categories, the project had significant favourable impacts on agriculture, nutrition, education, child health, maternal health, HIV and malaria, and water and sanitation. A third of the targets were met in the project sites. Total on-site spending decreased from US$132 per person in the first half of the project (of which $66 was from the MVP) to $109 per person in the second half of the project (of which $25 was from the MVP).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThe MVP had favourable impacts on outcomes in all MDG areas, consistent with an integrated rural development approach. The greatest effects were in agriculture and health, suggesting support for the project's emphasis on agriculture and health systems strengthening.

While the hope is that promising programs will be scaled up, we have few successful examples of this scale-up process in practice. Ideally we would like to know which programs will work at large scale before we invest the resources to take them to scale. But it would seem that the only way to tell whether a program works at scale is to test it at scale. Our goal in this paper is to propose a way out of this Catch-22. We first develop a simple model that helps clarify the type of scale-up challenge for which our method is most relevant. Most social programs rely on labor as a key input (teachers, nurses, social workers, etc.). We know people vary greatly in their skill at these jobs. So social programs, like firms, confront a search problem in the labor market that can lead to inelastically-supplied human capital. The result is that as programs scale, either average costs must increase if program quality is to be held constant, or else program quality will decline if average costs are held fixed. Our proposed method for reducing the costs of estimating program impacts at large scale combines the fact that hiring inherently involves ranking inputs with the most powerful element of the social science toolkit: randomization. We show that it is possible to operate a program at modest scale n but learn about the input supply curves facing the firm at much larger scale S \u00d7 n by randomly sampling the inputs the provider would have hired if they operated at scale S \u00d7 n. We build a simple two-period model of social-program decision making and use a model of Bayesian learning to develop heuristics for when scale-up experiments of the sort we propose are likely to be particularly valuable.

Second, a reservoir of extreme poverty remains in low-income countries where growth is erratic and aid often fails to reach the poor.

This dissertation offers an analysis of the non-price approaches, including the rationing of water for particular users, installation of particular technologies, and adoption of particular certifications to achieve environmental goals. To begin, an analysis of California\u2019s 2015 urban water conservation mandate was performed. Results indicate that the average welfare loss of the mandate is $6,107 per acre-foot of restriction in Northern California and $2,757 per acrefoot of restriction in Southern California. In terms of monthly household-level willingness-to-pay (WTP) to avoid the mandate, results illustrate that households have a WTP between $5 and $200 per month. Northern Californian utilities were generally in compliance with their mandated conservation targets, while Southern Californian utilities tended to fall short. The second essay focuses on analyzing how web-based Home Water Use Reports (HWURs) affect household-level water consumption in Folsom City, California. The HWURs under study, offered by the company Dropcountr (DC), share social comparisons, consumption analytics, and conservation information to residential accounts, primarily through digital communications. We found that there is a 7.8% reduction in average daily household water consumption for a typical household under treatment of the DC program. Results suggest that the effect of DC varies by the baseline consumption quintile, the number of months in the program, the day of the week, message type, and enrollment wave. Furthermore, we find that indicate these responses to DC program likely come from the information channel rather than moral suasion. The final essay studies the effectiveness of ISO-14001 on pollution reduction as a non-price pollution control approach. Manufacturers have been increasingly relying on environmental management systems (such as ISO 14001 based ones) to comply with government regulations and reduce waste. In this essay, we investigated the impact of ISO 14001 certification on manufacturers\u2019 toxic release by release level. Results show that ISO 14001 had a negative and statistically significant effect on the top 10% manufacturing sites regarding the on-site toxic release, but it did not reduce off-site toxic release.

However, this overall effect masks heterogeneity across and within courses: In one course the planning prompt increases course completion by 19%, highlighting the importance of replications in slightly different contexts.

Price Major Department: Economics This dissertation consists of three essays that evaluate the effectiveness of interventions promoting residential energy conservation. I study three programs that were implemented as natural field experiments by energy utilities in the United States. In the experiments, households were randomly assigned to a control group that was not exposed to the program or to treatment groups that participated in the program(s). The main objective of this research agenda is to generate insights that help design effective energy policy. In the first chapter, I study a program that provided weekly emails containing information about a customer\u2019s natural gas expenditure to more than 150,000 households in California. I find that exposure to the emails caused significant reductions in natural gas use. Additional analyses suggest that households changed their heating behavior in response to the program. Furthermore, reductions in usage persisted over a 20-month treatment period. The second chapter focuses on the interaction between a voluntary financial rewards program for reductions in energy use and the Home Energy Report (HER), a repeated mailer that compares a recipient\u2019s consumption to that of similar households. We test whether the introduction of financial incentives increased energy savings by households that also received the HER. Our findings show that the two programs complemented each other in several important ways and promoted larger energy savings by a broader set of customers than the HER alone. Finally, the third chapter investigates whether social nudges, such as the HER, are subject to crowd out effects. Crowd out occurs when the effectiveness of a new social nudge is negatively affected by previous exposure to an existing social nudge. We use two distinct social nudges in an experiment in which households are exposed to no nudge, one nudge in isolation, or both nudges in combination. To determine the extent of crowd out, we compare the effect of the combined intervention to the summation of the effects of each nudge in isolation. We do not find evidence of crowd out. In contrast, the combined effect was marginally larger than the sum of the individual effects, although the difference is not statistically significant.

A central theme explored in this thesis is what determines the distribution of economic activities across space. My exploration in this direction begins with the roles of industrial pollution and transportation infrastructure in shaping the spatial distribution of skills, and extends to evaluate the spatial allocation efficiency of renewable energy projects. \nThe first chapter,\u201cThe Long Shadow of Industrial Pollution: Environmental Amenities and the Distribution of Skills\u201d, investigates the role of industrial pollution in determining the competitiveness of post-industrial cities, with a focus on their ability to attract skilled workers and shift to a modern service economy. I assemble a rich database at a fine spatial resolution, which allows me to track pollution from the 1970s to the present and to examine its impacts on a whole range of outcomes related to productivity and amenity, including house prices, employment, wages, and crime. I find that census tracts downwind of highly polluted 1970s industrial sites are associated with lower housing prices and a smaller share of skilled employment three decades later, a pattern which became evermore prominent between 1980 and 2000. These findings indicate that pollution in the 1970s affected the ability of parts of cities to attract skills, which in turn drove the process of agglomeration based on modern services. To quantify the contribution of different mechanisms, I build and estimate a multi-sector spatial equilibrium framework that introduces heterogeneity in local productivity and workers\u2019 valuation of local amenities across sectors and allows the initial sorting to be magnified by production and residential externalities. Structural estimation suggests that historical pollution is associated with lower current productivity and amenity; the magnitudes are higher for productivity, more skilled sectors and central tracts. I then use the framework to evaluate the impact of counterfactual pollution cuts in different parts of cities on nationwide welfare and cross-city skill distribution. \nThe second chapter, \u201cTravel Costs and Urban Specialization: Evidence from China\u2019s High Speed Railway\u201d examines how improvements in passenger transportation affect the spatial distribution of skills, exploiting the expansion of high speed railway (HSR) project in China. This natural experiment is unique because as a passenger-dedicated transportation device that aims at improving the speed and convenience of intercity travel, HSR mostly affects urban specialization through encouraging more frequent intercity trips and face-to-face interactions. I find that an HSR connection increases city-wide passenger flows by 10% and employment by 7%. To further deal with the issues of endogenous railway placement and simultaneous public investments accompanying HSR connections, I examine the impact of a city\u2019s market access changes purely driven by the HSR connection of other cities. The estimates suggest that HSR-induced expansion in market access increases urban employment with an elasticity between 2 and 2.5. The differential impacts of HSR on employment across sectors suggest that industries benefiting more from enhanced market access are the ones intensive in nonroutine cognitive skills, such as finance, IT and business services. These findings highlight the role of improved passenger travel infrastructure in promoting the delivery of services, facilitating labour sourcing and knowledge exchange across cities, and ultimately shifting the specialization pattern of connected cities towards skilled and communication intensive sectors. \nIn the last chapter, \u201cWhere does the Wind Blow? Green Preferences and Spatial Misallocation in the Renewable Energy Sector\u201d , I focus on the spatial allocation efficiency of renewable energy projects. How efficiently are renewable energy projects distributed across the US? Are \u201cgreener\u201d investors worse at picking sites? Using extensive information on wind resources, transmission, electricity prices and other restrictions that are relevant to the siting choices of wind farms, I calculate the predicted profitability of wind power projects for all possible locations across the contiguous US, use this distribution of this profitability as a counterfactual for profit-maximizing wind power investments and compare it to the actual placement of wind farms. The average predicted profit of wind projects would have risen by 47.1% had the 1770 current projects in the continental US been moved to the best 1770 sites. I also show that 80% and 42% respectively of this observed deviation can be accounted for by within-state and within-county distortions. I provide further evidence that a large proportion of the observed within-state spatial misallocation is related to green investors\u2019 tendency of invest locally and sub-optimally. Wind farms in more environmentally-friendly counties are more likely to be financed by local and non-profit investors, are closer to cities, are much less responsive to local fundamentals and have worse performance ex-post. The implementation of state policies such as Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and price-based subsidies are related to better within-state locational choices through attracting more for-profit investments to the \u201cbrown\" counties, while lump-sum subsidies have the opposite or no effects. My findings have salient implications for environmental and energy policy.
