Five different internet user profiles were identified (encompassing interest-driven, friendship-driven, abstinent, irregular, and excessive users). Interest-driven users participated in interest- and media-oriented activities. Adolescents in the interest-driven user group were more likely to be boys and participants with low academic achievement, high parental monitoring, and high problematic social media use. Friendship-driven users participated in socially oriented activities. Adolescents in the friendship-driven user group were more likely to be girls and participants aged 13 or 15, with high peer and family support. Abstinent users participated only in entertainment, while irregular users showed no particularly high involvement in any internet activity. Adolescents in the abstinent and irregular user groups were likely to be boys and participants aged 11 with high family support. Excessive users had high involvement in internet activities overall.

Findings indicate: (1) students were inclined to provide short responses to move on with composing practices; (2) group discussions while multimodal composing followed three stages: mode and story exploration, mode-story integration, and mode-story completion; (3) multimodal comics fostered the most discussion; (4) different modes supported self-oriented and group-oriented contributions in unique ways.

We found that amidst gaps in infrastructural support from schools, workplaces, and communities, parents experienced deep anxiety and took on new roles, including tech support, school administrator, and curator of meaningful activities for their children. As parents shared bold and creative technology-based solutions for improving family well-being, schooling experiences, social life, and beyond, they demonstrated their capacity to contribute to new models of learning and family life.

This hypothesis was approached from the framework of connected learning, referring to the process of connecting self-regulated and interest-driven learning across formal and informal contexts. We tested this hypothesis with longitudinal data. It was of interest how digital engagement, operationalized as a general digital learning preference, wish for digital schoolwork, and their interaction, is related to traditional school engagement. This was examined both cross-sectionally in three time points and longitudinally across three years. The participants were 1,705 (43.7% female) 7th\u20139th graders (13-15 years old) from 27 schools in Helsinki, Finland. We explored the structure of correlations between latent constructs at each time point separately, and finally, to evaluate longitudinal relations between digital engagement and school engagement we specified latent cross-lagged panel models. The results indicate that students holding a stronger general digital learning preference experienced higher schoolwork engagement, both contemporaneously and over time, indicating successful connected learning. However, the results also showed support for the gap hypothesis: Students who preferred digital learning but did not have the chance to digitally engage at school, experienced a decrease in school engagement over time.

The findings revealed that while efforts are being made to assess the outcomes of makerspaces, methods and techniques are primarily informal. Current formal reporting relies upon quantitative measurement, such as visitor or participant numbers, which fails to capture the effects of the service on users. The implication is that staff may develop more structured and formalized approaches to assessing the outcomes of makerspaces.

The results of a survey conducted at the end of 2018 are presented herein, based on a sample of 2,900 Spanish minors between 9 and 17 years of age who use Internet. The impact of the diverse parental mediation strategies applied to Internet use has been calculated by taking into account the sociodemographic factors of the participating minors (age and gender). Association analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical analysis programme. In this case, an extra analysis was carried out with regard to the relationship of influence between different strategies and the rules of behaviour and family support in the household context as perceived by the minor. Findings suggest that enabling and restrictive mediation strategies are very common in Spanish families, while technical mediation strategies have a very limited presence. It is noteworthy that restrictions and security strategies generally apply more to girls than to boys. Household rules related to the behaviour of minors have a positive correlation with an increase of influence of nearly all strategies. However, there is no relevant association between family support perceived by children and restrictive strategies and techniques applied by parents.\nEste art\u00edculo explora las estrategias de mediaci\u00f3n parental online en Espa\u00f1a y c\u00f3mo los factores sociodemogr\u00e1ficos y del contexto familiar se asocian con ellas.

We used exploratory structural equation modeling to investigate the factor structure of SDP and further structural relations to study engagement and study burnout. Despite some differences between the three student cohorts regarding the factor structure of SDP, the same five dimensions of participation were identified in all of them: social networking oriented participation, knowledge-oriented participation, media-oriented participation, action gaming, and social gaming. In the high school sample also a sixth factor, blogging-oriented participation, differentiated from the knowledge oriented dimension. Taken together, using digital technologies to communicate and maintain social networks (social networking), was consistently either related to lower study engagement or to higher study burnout. Playing of action and sports games (action gaming) was related in all samples either to lower engagement or higher cynicism. Using digital tools to gain and share knowledge (knowledge-oriented) was, in contrast, related to higher study engagement. The results demonstrate that students' digital activities reflect multiple dimensions that are differently related to academic well-being.

Towards that end, the gap hypothesis, that is, the hypothesis that students who prefer learning with digital media outside of school are less engaged in traditional school, was examined both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Digital engagement was conceptualized as both socio-digital participation (i.e. adolescents\u2019 multidimensional practices of participating in digital contexts) and connected learning (i.e. self-regulated learning extended across time, space, and various contexts). Academic and emotional functioning was conceptualized as academic well-being (i.e. school engagement and burnout: exhaustion, cynicism, and inadequacy), motivation (i.e. achievement goal orientations), and academic achievement (i.e. grades). The first aim was to determine the multidimensional structure of socio-digital participation orientations that students\u2019 different digital activities reflect. The second aim was to examine the extent to which the orientations of socio-digital participation are related to academic and emotional functioning cross-sectionally and in different educational levels. The third aim was to examine the longitudinal relations of socio-digital engagement with academic well-being and academic achievement, especially focusing on the direction of the effects. This thesis consists of five original studies. In these studies, we used interview data, cross-sectional and longitudinal questionnaire data, and grades drawn from the registry.

The goal of Study III was to extend the investigation of the differences in young peoples\u2019 approaches to socio-digital participation. First, the structure of the underlying orientations of socio-digital participation was examined across three samples of Finnish students. Second, we analyzed how these different orientations are associated with school engagement and burnout. In Study IV, the gap hypothesis was tested with longitudinal data. Finally, the goal of Study V was to expand our knowledge about how adolescents\u2019 socio-digital participation is longitudinally related to school burnout and academic achievement. More specifically, Study V focused on the directions of effects among these constructs at the within-person level. The first main finding was that the variation in digital activities can be explained with a complex structure of socio-digital participation orientations, which appear to be consistent across different age groups. Of all forms of digital participation, youths reported spending the majority of their screen time engaging in friendship-driven digital social networking. However, some adolescents reported socio-digital engagement that reached out to a wider audience, including sharing their art, providing a game server to facilitate other people\u2019s gaming activities, or building an extended network of developing expertise in the process. The second main finding was that there truly appeared to be a gap between adolescents\u2019 digital and academic engagement. The results revealed that motivationally indifferent students were more likely to engage in social media and gaming. Students who preferred digital learning but did not have the chance to digitally engage at school experienced a decrease in school engagement over time. Moreover, cynicism towards school and feelings of inadequacy predicted increased engagement with social media and action gaming. The third main finding was that digital participation yields both demands and resources and that these are tied together via multiple processes. Social media engagement was cross-sectionally related to lower study engagement and/or to higher symptoms of burnout, especially exhaustion. Longitudinally, social media engagement and emotional exhaustion were reciprocally related at the within-person level; exhaustion predicted an increase in social media engagement and vice versa. In turn, knowledgeoriented digital engagement was cross-sectionally related to higher study engagement, and digital learning preference predicted higher schoolwork engagement over time. To conclude, adolescents\u2019 socio-digital engagement is fundamentally multidimensional and should be treated as such. The results showed support to the gap hypothesis, but the results also suggest that the manifestation of this gap is dependent on multiple factors, both individual and contextual. The gap might emerge because of out-ofschool digital engagement that is not recognized in school or the gap might emerge due to problems in school leading to increased time spent with digital media. Intensive sociodigital engagement may also increase the daily psychological demands to such an extent that it hinders schoolwork, leading to symptoms of school burnout, but it can also increase the psychological resources supporting schoolwork given that congruence with academic practices is achieved.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 164, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "4242876", "name": "L.

It is unclear, however, how adolescents directly affected by teen pregnancy draw upon social norms against teen pregnancy in their own lives, whether the norms operate differently for girls and boys, and how these social norms affect pregnant or parenting adolescents. Objective This research aims to examine whether and how US adolescents use, interpret, and experience social norms against teen pregnancy. Methods Online ethnographic methods were used for the analysis of peer-to-peer exchanges from an online social network site designed for adolescents. Data were collected between March 2010 and February 2015 (n=1662). Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results American adolescents in this online platform draw on dominant social norms against teen pregnancy to provide rationales for why pregnancy in adolescence is wrong or should be avoided. Rationales range from potential socioeconomic harms to life-course rationales that view adolescence as a special, carefree period in life. Despite joint contributions from males and females to a pregnancy, it is primarily females who report pregnancy-related concerns, including experiences of bullying, social isolation, and fear. Conclusions Peer exchange in this online forum indicates that American adolescents reproduce prevailing US social norms of viewing teen pregnancy as a social problem. These norms intersect with the norms of age, gender, and female sexuality. Female adolescents who transgress these norms experience bullying, shame, and stigma. Health professionals must ensure that strategies designed to prevent unintended adolescent pregnancy do not simultaneously create hardship and stigma in the lives of young women who are pregnant and parent their children.", "venue": "JMIR pediatrics and parenting", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 99, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46294291", "name": "K.

This study builds upon this developing field by exploring how 27 culturally and linguistically diverse 10th-grade students collaboratively interpreted literature by creating two digital projects\u2014a hypertext literary analysis and a video literary analysis. In particular, sociocultural and social semiotics theoretical frameworks were integrated to understand how working with visuals, sound, and text in digital spaces mediated students\u2019 interpretations of literature during their composing processes.

These findings contribute new insights into how multiple modes can serve as valuable tools for thinking during students\u2019 composing processes, including helping students to collaboratively discuss and articulate their understanding in complex and innovative ways.

In the age of social media, such role models may now be found more locally \u2013 in the same city \u2013 and perhaps with more diverse backgrounds. This may be particularly valuable to adolescents growing up in super-diverse cities, as they are surrounded by a multitude of groups and identities during a life phase in which they have to make sense of who they are and where they belong. Despite the heterogeneity of these identities, there is one thing all have in common: the city they live in. With the city as a common framework, local influencers may be important role models for these adolescents, particularly in negotiating their urban identity. This paper aims toward mapping the ways in which social media can play a role in the negotiation of urban identity among youngsters by investigating how YouTube influencers from a super-diverse city are related to each other online, and how their content relates to the (super-diverse) city of Rotterdam. Findings show that in their videos and on their channel pages, influencers mainly affiliate themselves with the city through having the city as the background and context of the videos, through their involvement with cultural trends (e.g., soccer, hip-hop) that link to the city, and through their affiliation with other local influencers.

Scholars were more focused on the dangers and distresses than on the benefits that the technology would offer to young people. Accordingly, media literacy interventions were, then, designed to protect individuals from the harmful effects of the media. In particularly, in the 1980\u2019s, education about the media was mostly designed to protect youngsters from negative content of television (Guti\u00e9rez & Tyner, 2012: 441). Then, with the generalization of the Internet use, research about young people and the media, at first, often focused more on concerns about cyberbullying, sexual predators, and so on. When media literacy is positioned under a protectionist perspective, it is assumed that people need protection from something that is harmful and more powerful than them. In a time that individuals would only act as an audience, what they could do to change the agenda was somehow more limited. So, in a way, it is understandable that many media educative interventions had that protectionist tone. However, as the media landscape changed to give more participatory initiative to the audience, new opportunities arose. Abstract At first, research concerning young\u2019s relationship with the media was more focused on the dangers and distresses, than on the benefits that technology would offer to young people. However, after a while, an important shift occurred in the way how some researchers were framing their studies, focusing more on the opportunities posed by the use of the Internet by young people. In the light of the debate about the influence of (what some label as) fake news, particularly during the Brexit referendum and the presidential 2016 U.S. election trail, the discussion between risks and opportunities in media education is again pertinent. Some authors have sustained media literacy importance as a tool to react against the misinformation spread (Leetaru, 2016; McGivney, Kasten, Haugh, & DeVito, 2017), while others have been cautioning against a possible backlash effect (boyd, 2017; Craft, Ashley, & Maksl, 2017; Mihailidis & Viotty, 2017). Following Mihailidis and Viotty\u2019s (2017) suggestion for the need to reposition news literacy in the post-truth debate, this essay looks into the literature and proposes that news literacy education should be providing means of protection while also providing means of empowerment. Additionally, this essay concludes that scholars and educators should consider positioning news literacy education in relation with human rights, humanism and global education.

In the context of English youth and community work, this research project investigates digital tools, spaces and places as mediators of youth work practice, and proposes a model formulated through the identification of expansive drivers to guide both professional conduct and curriculum-based practice. The lives of English young people today are shaped by technologies which make interaction in a variety of digital spaces and places possible, yet there are divided views within the youth work community of practice about the place of digital tools, spaces and places as mediators of informal learning in a discipline traditionally focused on association, relationships and critical dialogue.

The data analysis uses the four areas where contradictions can manifest within CHAT activity systems to examine how the use of digital tools, spaces and places aligns with youth work values and principles, and to examine how they can mediate informal learning opportunities with young people. The contribution to knowledge comprises the identification of four \u2018spaces\u2019 which are named as safety, production, information and communication, and which form the basis of a model to scaffold the professional use of digital tools, spaces and places as mediators of youth work practice.

Metaphors of digital space and place emerging from within the DWR process are also appraised as a means to situate the work. The model is underpinned firstly by the premise that a youth worker\u2019s choice of digital tool, space or place needs to be based on the needs and input of young people. Secondly, that using digital tools, spaces and places as mediators of youth work practice is most effective as an extension to existing face-to-face youth work where relationships between young people and youth workers have already been formed.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 359, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "119506224", "name": "J.

M.S., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, 2017. Finding Street Gang Member Profiles on Twitter The crime and violence street gangs introduce into neighborhoods is a growing epidemic in cities around the world. Today, over 1.4 million people, belonging to more than 33,000 gangs, are active in the United States, of which 88% identify themselves as being members of a street gang. With the recent popularity of social media, street gang members have established online presences coinciding with their physical occupation of neighborhoods. Recent studies report that approximately 45% of gang members participate in online offending activities such as threatening, harassing individuals, posting violent videos or attacking someone on the street for something they said online in social media platforms. Thus, their social media posts may be useful to social workers and law enforcement agencies to discover clues about recent crimes or to anticipate ones that may occur in a community. Finding these posts, however, requires a method to discover gang member social media profiles. This is a challenging task since gang members represent a very small population compared to the active social media user base. This thesis studies the problem of automatically identifying street gang member profiles on Twitter, which is a popular social media platform that is commonly used by street gang members to promote their online gang-related activities. It outlines a process to curate one of the largest sets of verifiable gang member Twitter profiles iii that have ever been studied. A review of these profiles establishes differences in the language, profile and cover images, YouTube links, and emoji shared on Twitter by gang members compared to the rest of the Twitter population. Beyond the earlier efforts in Twitter profile identification that utilize features derived from the profile and tweet text, this thesis uses additional heterogeneous sets of features from the emoji usage, profile images, and links to YouTube videos reflecting gang-related music culture towards solving the gang member profile identification problem. Features from this review are used to train a series of supervised machine learning classifiers and they are further improved upon by using word embeddings learned over a large corpus of tweets.

The sociotechnological model served as a sensitising theoretical framework for this study. Seven families (22 individuals) took part in group and individual interviews. The data obtained from interviews were analysed using constant comparative method. The results showed that influences of SNS on satisfaction with family leisure and family satisfaction varied: the use of SNS helped families to build enjoyable family leisure, stay connected with family members and increase a sense of belonging. In some cases, however, it also decreased the amount of time spent with family, lowered attention during face-to-face interactions, provided opportunity for negative comparisons and caused concerns about the development of social skills among youth. In turn, family relationships and satisfaction with family life influenced the way family members used SNS for leisure. Some participants increased the use of SNS during times of family conflict in order to seek support and as a way to distract themselves from unpleasant thoughts.

Using a spatiotemporal framewo rk, I analyze youth learning locative literacies along lines they made of their neighborhood through a designed task, global positioning system (GPS) drawing. First, I focus on young people learning to scale their mobility to a neighborhood grid along lines they made through walking and gesture. Second, I focus on young people learning to negotiate inscriptions along lines they made by walking with maps and GPS devices through their neighborhood. Third, I focus on youth learning to re-member their embodied effort along lines they made discursively during moments of reflection. The analyses are intended to push the field\u2019s understanding of mobility in conceptualizing and designing new forms of learning locative literacies.

The thesis focuses on four key areas identified during the research. Firstly, the thesis highlights the embodied rhythms or pace and journeys or wayfaring that characterise how young people move in and between digital media and that are not captured by studies focusing on typologies of internet use. Secondly, the thesis discusses how young people with physical disabilities struggle to overcome stigma and exclusion in their online relationships, as rather than facilitate disembodied communication(s), digital media is increasingly saturated with normative visuality. Thirdly, the thesis discusses how young people with physical disabilities use of digital media is regulated by their teachers and parents, often limiting their use of this medium. Finally, the thesis explores how the young people enact disability in different contexts including the special school, mainstream colleges and the home, and what this tells us about these institutional contexts. In addition to participant observation the fieldwork also involved in-depth interviews with a small cohort of young people with physical disabilities and video diaries produced by participants that showcased how they use the internet in the home. Interviews were also carried out with some school staff from the special school as well as parents of participants. Home visits enabled observation of how participants use the internet in domestic settings, and some participants were followed to their mainstream colleges as they progressed into further education, or attended placements during the two-year period. \nA concern addressed in the thesis is how inequalities are reproduced and embedded in young people with physical disabilities habitual use of the internet. At the same time, the study found that these young people used the internet much in the same way as their able-bodied peers, for example, to play games, socialise and post images to garner approval. Video diaries revealed significant differences in the rhythms and journeys underpinning the way in which the young people used digital media, articulating contextual and habitual factors and the level of their disability. \nFurthermore, these young people used the internet to find, build and maintain social relationships online, to explore their sexuality and to engage in self-promotion on social networking sites. However, when online they also encountered various obstacles and struggled to overcome bodily stigma and exclusion within the visual and narrowly normative presentation of the self-online. \nSchool teachers and parents were found to adhere to regulatory policies and advice on how to mediate young people s access and use to digital media. This study found the regulatory practices (monitoring, blocking, filtering content) restricted how young people with physical disabilities could access and use digital media in the home and at school. For some participants their gender and ethnicity was found to intersect with their disability making them subject to substantial regulatory practices in the home. Moreover, the students who were more able-bodied found ways to evade the regulatory practices encountered in the school and at home. \nFinally, the study also found that the special school created a protective environment that fosters an inclusive space, where students with different abilities can prosper. In contrast however, their transition to mainstream colleges reveal that when they are expected to practice and adjust their disability to the normative practices in place for able-bodied students, they become hindered in their ability to feel included and perform academically.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 189, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "116343270", "name": "Herminder Kaur"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "dd6f28c327624748f0a71bcc21f855c056d61e19", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/candc/KowCCN17", "MAG": "2656514928", "DOI": "10.1145/3059454.3059473"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd6f28c327624748f0a71bcc21f855c056d61e19", "title": "Creative Information Use Among Young Adults: Challenges for Learning and Opportunities for Media (Re)Design", "abstract": "Despite spending significant amounts of time on the Internet, today's young adults often do not use online information effectively to support their creative pursuits--an activity we refer to as creative information use.

One example is a multimedia poem about the underrepresentation and invisibility of racialized minority students at a major American university.

That is, young people are finding civic resources and building on each other\u2019s work to challenge the social order.

A sociological complement to the psychological construct of motivation, investment has become a pivotal construct in applied linguistics and language education (Kramsch, 2013), and makes visible the relations of power that enable or constrain language learning and teaching. The paper focuses on Darvin and Norton\u2019s expanded model of investment, which responds to changes in the communicative landscape spurred by technology. Seeking to address the paradoxes of globalization and the invisible mechanisms of power in the knowledge economy, the model locates investment at the intersection of identity, capital and ideology. As such, it provides an important elaboration of the ways in which the right to speak needs to be understood as materially and ideologically constructed. Drawing on data from learners in Canada and Uganda, the paper demonstrates how investment is shaped by the positioning of learners, their negotiation of learning affordances, and the systemic patterns of control that impinge on their agency.

The results of this multiple case study comprise multiple perspectives from youth from eight different countries, map characteristics of youth-focused social media networks, and explore how these affinity spaces foster learning and activism. In this regard, this project provides a typology of youth social media usage for learning about and engaging in activism on environmental sustainability issues. This typology responds to the overarching research question of the study: \u201cHow are youth using social media sites for learning about and engaging in activism on environmental sustainability issues?\u201d \n \nThis research project is situated within an interpretivist/constructivist paradigm and is primarily focused on how youth engage in social media practices and understand their subjective experiences of social media, as well as how these experiences inform their learning and activism. The youths' accounts do not result in a definitive or generalizable theory of global youth social media usage, but these accounts elucidate the substance, structure and dynamics of informal interest-driven learning as understood by youth participants. Data collection consisted of an online questionnaire, interviews, and social media data capture. The online questionnaire provided context on how youth use technology, frequency of use, and how they position social media in relation to environmental learning and activism. The online questionnaire also provided opportunity for youth to volunteer to participate in a 6 month social media observation period. Using Nvivo 10's NCapture, youth's personal profiles along with their participation in one environmental social media interest group were captured. Interviews were conducted at the commencement of the observation period and at the end of the 6 month period. \n \nAll data were analysed qualitatively and resulted in three results chapters: Chapter 4 presents a summary of findings from the online questionnaire, individual cases of youth participants and their respective networks, and a cross-case analysis drawing upon several aspects of the structural aspects of the environmental social media interest groups. Chapter 5 presents youth perspectives and reflections on their learning within environmental social media interest groups and Chapter 6 presents youth perspectives and reflections on activism. \n \nThe cases and chapters on learning and activism offer evidence that within informal environmental social media interest groups important learning, identity development, and antecedents of democratic civic processes can occur. There are several examples of substantive knowledge about environmental sustainability issues deepening as a result of youth participating in environmental social media interest groups. There are also examples of the importance of the relationships which are developed, fostered, or continued through online engagement in these spaces.

Engineering in K-12 education. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2009). In this chapter, we present the Studio STEM model, which is comprised of theory, curricula, training, implementation, and assessment that attempts to overcome known barriers. Studio STEM is an out-of-school, design-based science and engineering program intended to engage middle school youth in critical STEM concepts and practices. The design principles that frame the model include: curricula based on science inquiry, engineering design, studio-based learning, technology-enhanced experiences and opportunities, and a focus on community connections through service organizations and businesses. The Studio STEM model addresses several issues identified by recent reports that highlight potential hindrance of full adoption of integrative STEM programming. We offer the framework by which Studio STEM was intentionally designed to be a practical program based on current theory and research.

Traditional assessments often fail to capture the ways youth learn in informal settings, and deep science understandings are notoriously difficult to measure. In this study, we examined three after-school settings where 65 youth were learning science through engineering design challenges. In this informal setting, we examined storyboards, social networking forum (SNF) chat logs, videos of whole-class interactions, interviews with groups and single participants, and traditional multiple-choice pre- and posttest results. As we looked for evidence of learning, we found that the social networking forum was rich with data. Interviews were even more informative, much more so than traditional pencil and paper multiple-choice tests. We found that different kinds of elicitation strategies adopted by site leaders and facilitators played an important role in the ways youth constructed knowledge. These elicitation strategies also helped us find evidence of learning.

There was no significant difference in time spent on SNS between adolescents in the two countries; however, significant differences in the way adolescents use SNS were found. Australian adolescents tended to use SNS for group activities, whereas Koreans used it for social monitoring. There was a positive relationship between SNS use and online social capital in both countries. However, the types of social capital that were found to have a strong relationship to SNS use were different. Among Australian adolescents, SNS activities had a higher correlation with bonding social capital compared to bridging capital, whereas the result was contrasting among Korean adolescents. The impact of SNS use on online social capital differed between the two countries, showing that Australian adolescents reporting low SNS use gained online social capital if they used SNS more intensely. Finally, the impact of SNS use and culture on perceived online social capital was examined by conducting hierarchical multiple regressions. Interpersonal communication and group activities emerged as significant predictors of online social capital.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 74, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49685573", "name": "J.

The research was conducted in a rural east Texas town, with two student groups, 13-14 year-olds (middle school) and 18-20 year-olds (university), between 2007 and 2008, at a time when 2G cell phones were the norm. The analysis adopts and applies the domestication framework developed by Silverstone and Hirsch (1992) within work on the social shaping of technology (Haddon, 2004; Berker, 2006; Selwyn, 2012), and points to some limitations and areas for further development within this approach. \n\nThe thesis explores the extent to which teens use of the cell phone serves as a vehicle for self-expression and collective identity. It considers their emotional investment and connection with the cell phone as an extension of the self ; as well as its role as a focus for, and a means of, regulation of young people both by adults and by peers. The analysis suggests that, far from being a matter of free choice and autonomy, teens use of cell phones may be restricted by cost (of texting, calling plan), features (of particular phones), and by parental or institutional rules about how, where and when cell phones may be used. Use may also be regulated by peers in terms of when and with whom to talk or text, enabling peer groups to exclude others. \n\nThrough the lens of the domestication framework this thesis concludes that teens in this context are not an homogenous group: the ways they incorporate the cell phone into their everyday lives may differ to a degree, not least as a result of parental and institutional regulation. The research does, however, identify broad areas of consensus among teens, partly linked to the geographical and socio-economic context of the participants, which provides a useful comparison with research undertaken on teens elsewhere in the world.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 535, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "34948513", "name": "C.

Today\u2019s learners have been attracted to interactive media involving content creation, but such activating learning environments are rarely employed at school. To address this challenge, I started this research on pedagogical potentials of publishingoriented learner-generated video production. The process, implementing new literacies, offered an alternative to traditional instruction as well as opportunities for multilevel social interaction. Online publishing of the videos as a natural continuation of the process enabled interaction between school and society. In this research, I examined through three case studies what kinds of social interaction emerge in this context and how interaction can be improved. I collected the data in primary and secondary schools by observing and video recording discussions in video projects and by interviewing students, teachers and parents. I employed a quantifying method to analyze group interaction and its development and used inductive qualitative methods to examine teacher\u2013student interaction and interaction at the societal level. The findings emphasize the crucial role of the teacher in orchestrating social interaction. The observed peer group was actively involved in planning their joint video story, but the open-ended fictional task challenged interaction. Despite initial disputational and modest discussion the group learned to \u2018intercreate\u2019 due to minimal scaffolding provided by the teacher. Occasionally, wholeclass discussions were dominated by the teacher and two to three students. Online publishing of the videos appeared to generate contradictory feelings. In primary schools videos were largely published online, but in secondary schools students were more reluctant to publish their schoolcontext videos. Interaction was scarce between students, teachers and parents even though they were invited to discuss the media ground rules of online publishing activities. In order to improve interaction processes and environments, the teacher needs to designate carefully scripted subtasks, provide reflective scaffolding as well as implement media encouragement to enable interaction between school and society.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 202, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1410584129", "name": "Laura Palmgren-Neuvonen"}]}}, {"contexts": ["This pattern I observed reflects other studies of kids' uses of new media and technologies - many kids are increasingly using and interacting with technologies, but few are taking up opportunities to create and design with technology (Livingstone & Helsper, 2007; Ito et al., 2009).", "Access to peers and other makers can be valuable to find people with shared interests, get feedback and inspiration, brainstorm ideas, work on projects together, and deepen expertise (Ito et al., 2009)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background", "result"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "bbe9d923284bbe063b22cbddbb2178446578cf92", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2603213364"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbe9d923284bbe063b22cbddbb2178446578cf92", "title": "Family creative learning : designing structures to engage kids and parents as computational creators", "abstract": "The ability to create, design, and express oneself with technology is an important fluency for full participation in today's digitally mediated society.

I especially focus on families with limited access to resources and social support around computing. I describe the design of a community-based outreach program called Family Creative Learning, which invites kids, their families, and other families in their community to create and learn together using creative technologies. I use a qualitative approach to document the complex and diverse learning experiences of families. Through studies of family participation, I examine how kids and their parents supported one another and how the Family Creative Learning environment, activities, tools, and facilitation supported families in their development as computational creators. As families built projects, they also built perspectives in how they saw themselves, each other, and computing developing identities as computational creators.

We compared the group memberships in their use of socio-digital technologies and related functioning as we expected to find a gap between some digital natives and current educational practices which do not include socio-digital technology in feelings of cynicism towards school. Latent profile analysis identified five groups: Engaged (50%) students, who formed the majority; Stressed (4%) students, who reported high exhaustion and high inadequacy as a student; Students High in cynicism (burnout group) (5%) with high scores on all the components of school burnout, particularly cynicism, but also on exhaustion and inadequacy as a student; students Moderate in Cynicism (15%), whose cynicism was directed in particular towards studying and school; and, finally, students Emerging Cynicism (bored group) (26%), whose feelings of cynicism were nevertheless elevated. These results thus revealed that almost half (46%) of the elementary students felt some degree of cynicism towards school, thereby supporting our gap hypothesis: these groups of cynical students reported that they would be more engaged at school if socio-digital technologies were used at school.

This book offers a comparative analysis summarising the results of the research and exploring the impact of social media on politics and gender, education and commerce. What is the result of the increased emphasis on visual communication? Are we becoming more individual or more social? Why is public social media so conservative? Why does equality online fail to shift inequality offline? How did memes become the moral police of the internet? Supported by an introduction to the project\u2019s academic framework and theoretical terms that help to account for the findings, the book argues that the only way to appreciate and understand something as intimate and ubiquitous as social media is to be immersed in the lives of the people who post. Only then can we discover how people all around the world have already transformed social media in such unexpected ways and assess the consequences.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 175, "citationCount": 315, "influentialCitationCount": 24, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145871506", "name": "Danny Miller"}, {"authorId": "38138659", "name": "Elisabetta Costa"}, {"authorId": "83772749", "name": "N.
