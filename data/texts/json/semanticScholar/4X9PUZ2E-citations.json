Our database included 64 knowledge exhibitions on the Scoop.it platform. Factor analysis of curator\u2019s activities resulted in 3 factors, contributing 57.63% of the total variance explained: the social factor, the personal content factor and the personal process factor. Narratives of curators\u2019 reflections were analyzed using content analysis, resulting in 3 additional categories: relevance, curator activities and products. When combining the qualitative and quantitative categories, a two-dimensional conceptual model was constructed. The model illustrates a taxonomy of components that are included in the curation process, which portrays authentic learning. We conclude that curation contributes to the improvement of students\u2019 knowledge and 21st skills as curators. Curation requires personal and social skills, e.g., cognitive and meta-cognitive skills from an individual and social perspective, social skills on social media and affective skills. Hence, while focusing on personal skills in constructing an ontology, curation is also social in nature. Using social curation transforms learning, but surprisingly is uncommon in educational settings, and research is consequently meager. This highlights the need for incorporating curation as authentic learning in teacher training.", "venue": "Technol. Knowl.

To analyse contemporaneity, we take as main reference the studies of Gilles Lipovetsky, and his reflections on aesthetic capitalism.

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users\u2019 privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability.

Because of its intrinsic characteristics (i.e. accessibility, anonymity, or users\u2019 identity dissimulation), the internet has always been a useful tool for propagandists of Islamic fundamentalism (Fighel, 2007; Stenersen, 2008; Koehler, 2014). However, in the last decade, studies have questioned the real importance and magnitude of Islamic radicalization online (Gill et al., 2017). In fact, while scholars were focused on observing digital Islamic radicalization, a galaxy of new forms of extremism was growing online (Silva et al., 2017; Roversi, 2008) that no longer made Islam an exceptional case study. Today, Muslim people are one of the groups most aggressively targeted by extremist, intolerant, violent, and radical discourses (Elahi & Khan, 2017; Amnesty International, 2019). Anti-Muslim hate speech has spread online throughout Europe and the United States, reinforced by the propaganda and political discourse of populist right-wing parties (Hafez, 2014; Bakali 2016).

Obtaining a deeper insight into teachers' discourse regarding school digitalization and understanding teachers' worldviews in the educational-technological context may be viewed as crucially important since the latter tends to play a central role in the process of digitalization of teaching practices. Methods: This study addresses the following questions: (1) Was there a difference between the teachers regarding their foci of attention expressed via personal pronouns? (2) Was there a difference between the teachers in terms of the quality and degree of their emotional immersion in the discussed topic expressed through the use of emotion words? (3) What are the semantic fields of the word clusters that include the lexemes technology and digital, and do they implicitly convey differences in teachers' understanding of school digitalization? The data were extracted by means of in-depth interviews with 38 Israeli science teachers. The linguistic analysis was employed to examine teachers' language behavior. Results: The results point out the differences in teachers' worldviews, manifested through language behavior. In particular, the differences between the three groups of teachers (outside observers, circumspect participants, and conscientious participants) were found regarding their foci of attention, the level of emotional immersion, and their implicitly conveyed understanding of the digitalization of teaching practices. Conclusions: The teachers' worldviews are the key element for understanding what it means to be or not to be a teacher in a digital society.

For this purpose, the internet is explained in four \u2013 easily distinguishable, but obviously connected \u2013 contexts: we regard it as a system of technology, as an element of communication, as a cultural medium and as an independent organism. Based on these investigations we conclude that the internet is the medium of a new mode of human existence created by late modern man; a mode that is built on earlier (i.e., natural, and social) spheres of existence and yet it is markedly different from them.

Obtaining a deeper insight into teachers' discourse regarding school digitalization and understanding teachers' worldviews in the educational-technological context may be viewed as crucially important since the latter tends to play a central role in the process of digitalization of teaching practices. Methods: This study addresses the following questions: (1) Was there a difference between the teachers regarding their foci of attention expressed via personal pronouns? (2) Was there a difference between the teachers in terms of the quality and degree of their emotional immersion in the discussed topic expressed through the use of emotion words? (3) What are the semantic fields of the word clusters that include the lexemes technology and digital, and do they implicitly convey differences in teachers' understanding of school digitalization? The data were extracted by means of in-depth interviews with 38 Israeli science teachers. The linguistic analysis was employed to examine teachers' language behavior. Results: The results point out the differences in teachers' worldviews, manifested through language behavior. In particular, the differences between the three groups of teachers (outside observers, circumspect participants, and conscientious participants) were found regarding their foci of attention, the level of emotional immersion, and their implicitly conveyed understanding of the digitalization of teaching practices. Conclusions: The teachers' worldviews are the key element for understanding what it means to be or not to be a teacher in a digital society.

It arises from the deep interaction between the digital world and the ensemble of individuals and organizations that compose the complex domain of tourism, and mainly for what concerns tourism destinations. Here we go beyond the known considerations on the important role of ICTs and show how the virtual and the real components are strongly coupled and co-evolve forming a single system. The conceptual framework used is that of complexity science, and, in particular, the methods of network science. These allow to well assess both, the structural and dynamic characteristics of these complex digital ecosystems. Several examples from the recent literature show how these methods have been applied so far and the validity of the outcomes, as, besides a pure academic interest, they can help in providing a deeper and better knowledge of the issues considered and can, thus, inform policy and governance activities.

One the other hand, the digital and digitalization seems more important than ever: in times of Covid-19, it becomes clear that we were much too slow with digitalizing education, work, and other fields, and we should be damn lucky that we have all our digital tools to communicate and get information in times of lockdown: our lives literally depend on them.

One response to these concerns has been the orientation of scientific and technological efforts towards a responsible development of AI. This stance has been articulated from different perspectives. One is to focus on the risks associated with the autonomy of artificial entities, and one way of making this focus operational is the \u201cvalue-alignment problem\u201d (VAP); namely, to study how this autonomy may become provably aligned with certain moral values. With this purpose in mind, we advocate the characterisation of a problem archetype to study how values may be imbued in autonomous artificially intelligent entities. The motivation is twofold, on one hand to decompose a complex problem to study simpler elements and, on the other, the successful precedents of this artifice in analogous contexts (e.g. chess for cognitive AI, RoboCup for intelligent robotics). We propose to use agent-based modelling of policy-making for this purpose because policy-making (i) constitutes a problem domain that is rich, accessible and evocative, (ii) one may claim that it is an essentially value-drive process and, (iii) it allows for a crisp differentiation of two complementary views of VAP: imbuing values in agents and imbuing values in the social system in order to foster value-aligned behaviour of the agents that act within the system.

A cross-disciplinary literature framework from mainly international business and internet geography theory and a reflexive qualitative methodology are applied.\n\n\nFindings\nResults show that the relationship between the digital platform and the digital workers is characterized by mistrust and suffers from decreasing commitment levels soon after market entry. Uber mitigates its mistrust via control and scarce mechanisms. The digital drivers\u2019 \u201cillusionary freedom\u201d, a state in which they feel they can log on and log off at any time, enables the digital platform to gradually lower its commitment.

The Internet has in fact disrupted previous patterns of production, distribution and consumption of information.

Firstly, it critically analyses the risks resulting from social media\u2019s usage, with a special focus on personalization practices. Then, it explores the development of Public Service Broadcasting and questions the role that Public Service Media (PSM) has to sustain media quality, information diversity and, more generally, its traditional values. Thus, arguments in favor of a renovated and proactive role of Public Service Media are provided. In particular, an agonistic approach to social media, an \u2018architecture for serendipity\u2019 and the role of attention management are advocated.

Visions of man-computer symbiosis and the augmentation of man\u2019s intellect became realistic research objectives. The initial focus was on facilitating interactivity through improved interface technology, and supporting its application through good practices based on experience and psychological principles. Within a decade technology advances made low cost personal computers commonly available in the home, office and industry, and these were rapidly enhanced with software that made them attractive in a wide range of applications from games to office automation and industrial process control. Within three decades the Internet enabled human\u2013computer interaction to extend across local, national and international networks, and, within four, smartphones and tablets had made access to computers and networks almost ubiquitous to any person, at any time and any place. Banking, commerce, institutional and company operations, utility and government infrastructures, took advantage of, and became dependent on, interactive computer and networking capabilities to such an extent that they have now been assimilated in our society and are taken for granted. This hyperconnectivity has been a major economic driver in the current millennium, but it has also raised new problems as malevolent users anywhere in the world have become able to access and interfere with critical personal, commercial and national resources. A major issue for human\u2013computer studies now is to maintain and enhance functionality, usability and likeability for legitimate users whilst protecting them from malevolent users.

When it comes to topics as topical and shot through with multifarious anxieties as automation, it is, I argue, insufficient to rely on a conception of explicability as 'explanation' or 'simplification'.\n Instead, automation is the kind of topic that is challenging us to develop a more dynamic conception of explicability as explication. By this, I mean that automation is challenging us to develop epistemic strategies that are better capable of implicating people and their anxieties\n about automation in the topic, and, counterintuitively, of complicating how the topic is interfaced with. The article comprises an introduction followed by four main parts. While the introduction provides general context, each of the four subsequent parts seeks to demonstrate how diverse\n epistemic strategies might have a role to play in developing the process just described. Together, the parts are intended to build a cumulative case. This does not mean that the strategies they discuss are intended to be definitive, however \u2013 other strategies for making automation explicable\n may be possible and more desirable. Part one historicises automation as a concept. It does this through a focus on a famous passage from Descartes' Second Meditation, where he asks the reader to imagine automata glimpsed through a window. The aim here is to rehearse the presuppositions\n of a familiar 'modernist' epistemological model, and to outline how a contemporary understanding of automation as a wicked socio-economic problem challenges it. Parts two and three are then framed through concepts emerging from recent psychology: 'automation bias' and 'automation\n complacency'. The aim here is to consider recent developments in philosophy of technology in terms of these concepts, and to dramatically explicate key presuppositions at stake in the form of reasoning by analogy implied. While part two explicates an analogy between automation bias\n in philosophical engagements with technologies that involve a 'transcendental' tendency to reify automation, part three explicates an analogy between automation complacency and an opposed 'empirical turn' tendency in philosophy of technology to privilege nuanced description of case studies.\n Part four then conclude by arguing that anxieties concerning automation might usefully be redirected towards a different sense of the scope and purpose of philosophy of technology today: not as a movement to be 'turned' in one direction at the expense of others ('empirical' vs 'transcendental',\n for instance) but as a multidimensional 'problem space' to be explicated in many different directions at once.

Building the dwelling is synonymous of being in Heidegger\u2019s perspective, which means that constructing a shelter for our vulnerable bodies is a prerogative for fulfilling our potentials as humans. These constructs are physical materialisations of our experiences and knowledge of how it is to be a body and closely connected to the way we are in the world. It is being-in-the-world. These are constructions, frameworks, or scaffolds (Gestell) that uphold and withhold, on an existential level, identity, and selfhood. Without these scaffolds, we are left to the dangers and atrocities of life. The general opinion of Heidegger is that modernity has been systematically constructing cages, caves, and boxes that alienate and distance man from his true being. Technology has separated man from himself and made the opposite of true scaffolding, and hence from supporting man in his life. This chapter discusses the notions of scaffolding and enframing in relation to construction of identity and selfhood in virtual reality, as well as reflection on the possibilities of meaningful and responsible Onlife existence. Scaffolding is, as every scaffold-builder would know, an impossible individual enterprise. Actually, scaffolding has been seen as the ultimate metaphor for the collective and social endeavour, where the construction of the medieval cathedral has become iconic. Scaffolding in the Onlife reality, or making \u201cdigital assemblages\u201d, should be seen as actions of self-determination together with others, which means that the possible outcomes of scaffolds are both results of what the scaffold withholds, contains, and conceals, and the processes of co-construction, co-creation, co-shaping, and co-constitution with others in the scaffolding.

In order to understand this existential situation, we have to return to the notion of technology (tecnos\u2013logos). A broad definition led us to recognize all objects that are not \u201cnatural\u201d as technological, changing the domain of the artificial to the technological one. Another common misunderstanding is the confusion between technique and technology, as if the two terms identified the same sphere of reality. In this sense, we can summarize the status of contemporary technology by means of three main sentences: (1) Technology overlaps with the artificial; (2) Technology fundamentally coincides with its function of facilitating our work; (3) Technology is just a means, an instrument. Within this framework, the \u201clogos of the tecnos\u201d is thus entirely lost, meaning technology as a simple instrument or means in the context of a given action. The question is whether the logos refers to the tecnos or to the being that uses the tecnos. The independence (logos) of technology from human action as a unique characteristic of technological behavior obligates us to rethink ethics in the \u201ctechnological age:\u201d technological devices are not only used, but also interact with us. In this regard, we can say that technology has become an Environment for us, and we can no longer \u201cstop interacting\u201d with it.

The first recommendation offered in the report calls for \u201ccompulsory Code of Ethics for tech companies overseen by independent regulator\u201d. The recommendation is sensible and should be adopted. Scholars working in the area of digital ethics have often stressed the need for a code of ethics shaping the conduct of OSPs (Taddeo and Floridi 2017). And an authority with teeth enforcing the code should be a measure welcome by the public sector, civil society, and OSPs themselves. On the one hand, the authority would ensure that OSPs respect essential values and principles safeguarding users\u2019 rights and fundamental processes of our societies. On the other hand, an authority endorsing a code of ethics and recognising (when appropriate) compliance with it would help OSPs to improve their reputation, build their trustworthiness, and hence breed users\u2019 trust (Taddeo 2017). The content of the code to which OSPs should abide remains to be specified. This is a central question in the debate on the moral responsibilities of OSPs. The debate dates back to the early 2000 (Taddeo and Floridi 2015) and ranges from the moral responsibility of OSPs with respect to correcting biases in information indexing (Introna and Nissenbaum 2006; Granka 2010), protecting of users\u2019 privacy (Zhang et al. 2010) and security (Cerf 2011; Taddeo 2013, 2014), safeguarding democratic processes (Pariser 2012; Sunstein 2001; Floridi 2016), and respecting human rights, particularly freedom of information and freedom of internet (Broeders and Taylor 2017).

Both uses of values are specially relevant when one intends to design or validate that artificial intelligent systems behave in a morally correct way. In real life, the choice of policy components or the agreed upon benefit package are processes that involve argumentation. Likewise, the design and deployment of value-driven artificial entities may be well served by embedding practical reasoning capabilities in these entities or using argumentation for their design and certification processes. In this paper, we propose a formal framework to support the choice of actions of a value-driven agent and arrange them into plans that reflect the agent\u2019s preferences.

The law must aim to ensure good digital governance, both with respect to the development of algorithmic systems generally but also with respect to the use of AI specifically. Particularly formidable are the challenges associated with regulating the use of learning algorithms, such as in the case of machine learning. A great difficulty in this regard is ensuring transparency, accountability, responsibility, and the ability to make revisions, as well as preventing hidden discrimination.

In a more formal context, this is made clear and precise by speaking of levels of abstraction (Floridi 2008). Social scientists prefer to speak of \u201clenses\u201d, but the idea is the same. The point is not whether a description is accurate in absolute terms (is John a featherless biped? Or the details on his passport? Or 60% water and 40% something else? Or...) but whether it fulfils its purpose, and how well it does so, when compared with other descriptions. When we think that a description is the only one available, this is usually because we take its purpose for granted. Thus, we may describe an artefact as a \u201cvehicle\u201d because we take for granted a specific function or purpose of that artefact, but that description could easily change, if, for example, it is the SS-100-X presidential limousine in which Kennedy was a passenger when he was assassinated. All of a sudden \u201cvehicle\u201d is not wrong, but no longer satisfactory. This is the linguistic function of \u201cjust\u201d: it is no longer \u201cjust\u201d a vehicle. John is no longer \u201cjust\u201d a featherless biped or the details on his passport, because he is John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th president of the USA assassinated in 1963.

Cognitive technology can make use of information technology, but it strives to go beyond mere information processing by recognizing, changing, and creating meaning. This presents us with a two-sided challenge: On the one hand, cognitive technology is challenged to \u201cunderstand\u201d meaning in ordinary language. And on the other, it challenges us to rethink fundamental questions of human cognition and sense-making. Both challenges demand a better understanding of the difference between the technical transformation of symbols and the understanding of meaning in the ordinary sense. After explaining the topic in relation to both the insights and the limitations of the reflections by Turing, Searle, and Heidegger, this paper primarily builds on Wittgenstein\u2019s contributions to a better understanding of the difference between two conceptions of meaning and their implications for technical replication and simulation. The paper shows that Wittgenstein developed his early calculus account of meaning into that of language games and that language games not only come in many different varieties, but are also much more flexible than calculi. Of particular interest will be the difference between rigid and creative rule-following. Creative rule-following involves an intricate interplay of very different bodily, mental, and cultural constituents, so that its simulation is not merely a technical problem but also requires clarification of a number of profound philosophical questions. It will become clear that the challenge of cognitive technology shows up at unexpected places and that is much bigger than usually assumed. 1 Christoph Durt, Institute of Philosophy, University of Vienna, Austria; christoph@durt.de/www.durt.de", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 29, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5918716", "name": "Christoph Durt"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "56c8f31a58f5888f15879584302d84eb7e0e044a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2901789649", "DOI": "10.1215/18752160-7218182"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56c8f31a58f5888f15879584302d84eb7e0e044a", "title": "Networked Human, Network\u2019s Human: Humans in Networks Inter-Asia", "abstract": "Abstract This special issue explores the conceptions of the human that emerge out of the form and the design of information and communications technologies (ICTs).

Concepts of space, place and identity have become important when looking to understand elements of social practice, in light of the recognition that life is becoming progressively more mobile, varied and challenging. This has resulted in a shift in how subsequent generations experience space and place within digitally-mediated social landscapes. It is asserted that young people in contemporary society can be seen to occupy a hybrid virtual-real world (Jordan, B. (2009). Blurring boundaries: The \u2018real\u2019 and the \u2018virtual\u2019 in hybrid spaces. Human Organisation, 68.) where they experience the multiplication of place or duplication of space (Papacharissi, Z. (2011). A Networked Self: Identity Community and Culture on Social Network Sites. New York: Routledge). Such complex social geographies, we contend, have important implications for young people\u2019s negotiation and performance of identity, the acquisition of socio-technical capital (Resnick, (2002).

Upper Saddle River, NJ: ACM Press.) and, ultimately, digital well-being. In a time when there is a focus on developing global and connected citizens (Greene, M. (1995). Releasing the Imagination: Essay on education, the arts and social change. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.) we argue that pupils need to be both digitally fluent and values fluent as they negotiate spaces of reality and virtual reality. Both constructs require the learner to engage critically with information and misinformation as presented on ever-changing digital interfaces (Kahne, J., & Bowyer, B. (2017). Educating for Democracy in a Partisan Age: Confronting the Challenges of Motivated Reasoning and Misinformation. American Educational Research Journal, 54, 3\u201334.) and to make value choices. Given that physical education (PE) has been identified as a significant place for meaning-making (Spracklen, K. (2015). Digital Leisure, the Internet and Popular Culture: Communities and Identities in a Digital Age. London: Palgrave Macmillan.) and a core site for values-based education (Mccuaig, L., Marino, M., Gobbi, E., & Macdonald, D. (2015). Taught not Caught: Values based Education through physical education and School Sport: Literature Review. AIESEP Partners for WADA, ICSSPE, IOC, Fairplay & UNESCO.) it is identified as a key context in which to examine some of the challenges posed for students and educators with regard to values-based practices in digitally-mediated spaces.

Solutions for the mapping and delivery of the knowledge web are tentatively suggested, making use of an existing meta-property framework, the Open Graph.Smart learning environments focus on learning in geo-spatially relevant learning locations, with tutors or learners engaged in tasks that may frequently require the searching and selecting of knowledge content to contribute to learning or in the further production of new digital knowledge content. This has led to considerations regarding where and how knowledge content is obtained, provided, produced or shared, and this paper examines issues related to the producing, searching and finding of knowledge content in these learning contexts. Practical examples are provided to illustrate how digital knowledge content plays a pivotal role in learning design and learner interactions taking place in smart learning, both for the content of learning and as part of the process for learning.Emphasis is on open access smart learning in relation to connected and collaborative pedagogical approaches.

We grounded our concept on \u201cOnLife\u201d (Floridi, 2015) in which students used online information to find arguments for their actions. We created an AR-based campus tour for mobile devices in which students discussed content, identified correctness of online information and were asked to made a group decision. Four groups have been studied. Video-recorded observation and interviews were applied. During data analysis we found results that point to four distinctive patterns of relationships between social in-group dynamics and the identification of authentic online information: a) network of equal members, b) omission of one person, c) one person guides the others, d) no collaborative reasoning. The result is a \u2018Happy Surprise\u2019, it shows that social dynamics affected group performance stronger than equal access to online sources.
