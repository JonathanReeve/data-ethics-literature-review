This article investigates how the \u201cnew spirit of capitalism\u201d (Boltanski & Chiapello, 2007) gets inscribed in the fabric of search algorithms by way of social practices. Drawing on the tradition of the social construction of technology (SCOT) and 17 qualitative expert interviews I discuss how search engines and their \u201ccapital accumulation cycle\u201d (Fuchs, forthcoming) are negotiated and stabilized in a network of actors and interests, website providers and users first and foremost. I further show how corporate search engines and their capitalist ideology are solidified in a socio-political context characterized by a techno-euphoric climate of innovation and a politics of privatization. This analysis provides a valuable contribution to contemporary search engine critique mainly focusing on search engines\u2019 business models and societal implications. It shows that a shift of perspective is needed from impacts search engines have on society towards social practices and power relations involved in the construction of search engines to reconsider and renegotiate search engines and their algorithmic ideology in the future.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 146, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "40588447", "name": "Astrid Mager"}]}
