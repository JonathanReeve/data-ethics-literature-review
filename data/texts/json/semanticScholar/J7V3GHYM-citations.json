Drawing observations from the University of New Hampshire Library's work collecting undergraduate honors theses and other student research, this article discusses customization strategies for creating an effective workflow for student self-deposit using an iterative, feedback-based approach, and the benefits, challenges, and potential concerns of encouraging undergraduate participation in institutional repositories.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 13, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "152106486", "name": "Eleta Exline"}]}}]}
