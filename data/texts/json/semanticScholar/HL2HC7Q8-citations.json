These data, in quantities that exceed current analytical capabilities, have been described as \u201cthe new oil,\u201d an incomparable source of value. This is true for healthcare, as well. Conducting analyses of large, diverse, medical datasets promises the detection of previously unnoticed clinical correlations and new diagnostic or even therapeutic possibilities. However, using Big Data poses several problems, especially in terms of representing the uniqueness of each patient and expressing the differences between individuals, primarily gender and sex differences. The first two sections of the paper provide a definition of \u201cBig Data\u201d and illustrate the uses of Big Data in medicine. Subsequently, the paper explores the struggle to represent exhaustively the uniqueness of the patient through Big Data is highlighted prior to a deeper investigation of the digital representation of gender in personalized medicine. The final part of the paper put forward a series of recommendations for better approaching the complexity of gender in medical and clinical research involving Big Data for the creation or enhancement of personalized medicine services.

Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability.

Based on these findings: (1) most of the types of abuse which the Guidelines on Abusing Superior Bargaining Position (ASBP Guidelines) presented by Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) overlap with APPI provisions; (2) restrictions on abusing superior bargaining positions could play a specific role by applying itself to profiling activities which APPI might not effectively regulate.

The availability of large data sets has attracted researchers who are not traditionally associated with health data and its associated ethical considerations, such as computer and data scientists. Reliance on oversight by ethics review boards is inadequate and, due to the public availability of social media data, there is often confusion between public and private spaces. In addition, social media participants and researchers may pay little attention to traditional terms of use. In this paper, we review four cases involving ethical and terms-of-use violations by researchers seeking to conduct social media studies in an online patient research network. These violations involved unauthorized scraping of social media data, entry of false information, misrepresentation of researcher identities of participants on forums, lack of ethical approval and informed consent, use of member quotations, and presentation of findings at conferences and in journals without verifying accurate potential biases and limitations of the data. The correction of these ethical lapses often involves much effort in detecting and responding to violators, addressing these lapses with members of an online community, and correcting inaccuracies in the literature (including retraction of publications and conference presentations). Despite these corrective actions, we do not regard these episodes solely as violations. Instead, they represent broader ethical issues that may arise from potential sources of confusion, misinformation, inadequacies in applying traditional informed consent procedures to social media research, and differences in ethics training and scientific methodology across research disciplines. Social media research stakeholders need to assure participants that their studies will not compromise anonymity or lead to harmful outcomes while preserving the societal value of their health-related studies.

We then consider how these justifications translate to digital epidemiology, understood as an evolution of traditional epidemiology that includes personal and proprietary digital data alongside formal medical datasets. We consider the risks imposed by re-purposing such data for digital epidemiology and propose eight justificatory conditions that should be met in justifying a duty to participate for specific digital epidemiological studies. The conditions are then applied to three hypothetical cases involving usage of social media data for epidemiological purposes.

Surveillance cameras are situated on nearly every part of the railroad system, such as inside the cab, along the track, at grade crossings, and in stations. These camera systems are manually monitored, either live or subsequently reviewed in an archive, which requires an immense amount of human resources. To make the video analysis much less labor-intensive, this paper develops a framework for utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for the extraction of useful information from these big video datasets. This framework has been implemented based on the video data from one grade crossing in New Jersey. The AI algorithm can automatically detect unsafe trespassing of railroad tracks (called near-miss events in this paper). To date, the AI algorithm has analyzed hours of video data and correctly detected all near-misses. This pilot study indicates the promise of using AI for automated analysis of railroad video big data, thereby supporting data-driven railroad safety research. For practical use, our AI algorithm has been packaged into a computer-aided decision support tool (named AI-Grade) that outputs near-miss video clips based on user-provided raw video data.

Online gambling industry usually provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) meant mainly to enable third-party applications to network with their gambling services and enhance a user's gambling experience. In this industrial practice and experience paper, we advocate that such API's can also be used to retrieve gamblers' online data, such as browsing and betting history, promotions and available offers and use it to build more intel-ligent and proactive responsible gambling information systems. We report on our industrial experience in this field and make the argument that data available for persuasive marketing and usability should, under specific usage conditions, also be made available for responsible gambling information systems. This principle would provide equal opportunities for both directions. We discuss the psychological foundations of our proposed solution and the risks and challenges typically found when building such a software-assisted intervention, persuasion and emotion regulation technology. We also shed light on its potential implications from the perspectives of social corporate responsibility and data protection.

This can be ethically problematic, even where such data exist in the public domain. We set out to explore how the academic community is addressing these challenges by analysing a national corpus of research ethics guidelines and published studies in one interdisciplinary research area. Methods: Ethics guidelines published by Research Councils UK (RCUK), its seven-member councils and guidelines cited within these were reviewed. Guidelines referring to social media were classified according to published typologies of social media research uses and ethical considerations for social media mining. Using health research as an exemplar, PubMed was searched to identify studies using social media data, which were assessed according to their coverage of ethical considerations and guidelines. Results: Of the 13 guidelines published or recommended by RCUK, only those from the Economic and Social Research Council, the British Psychological Society, the International Association of Internet Researchers and the National Institute for Health Research explicitly mentioned the use of social media. Regarding data re-use, all four mentioned privacy issues but varied with respect to other ethical considerations. The PubMed search revealed 156 health-related studies involving social media data, only 50 of which mentioned ethical concepts, in most cases simply stating that they had obtained ethical approval or that no consent was required. Of the nine studies originating from UK institutions, only two referred to RCUK ethics guidelines or guidelines cited within these. Conclusions: Our findings point to a deficit in ethical guidance for research involving data extracted from social media. Given the growth of studies using these new forms of data, there is a pressing need to raise awareness of their ethical challenges and provide actionable recommendations for ethical research practice.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 128, "citationCount": 47, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2110316066", "name": "Joanna Taylor"}, {"authorId": "2938133", "name": "C.

We find that negative affect, and words related to anger in particular, increased for trans people in 2016. At the same time, social words used to describe family decreased, indicating that trans people may have interacted less with family and friends in late 2016. Self-disclosure decreased for trans women in 2016, potentially indicating increased political language vs. personal content, or selfcensorship in response to a hostile political environment.
