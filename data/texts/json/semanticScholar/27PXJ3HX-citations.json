However, research exploring the association between these feelings and team behaviour during such a crisis period has not been previously developed. Moreover, previous research has indicated that organisations are still struggling to understand the pandemic and its relationship with both team behaviour and developer feelings. To address this gap, we analysed how COVID-19 influences a developer's happiness and their feelings of (un)happiness associated with the team's behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. A state-of-the-art analysis helped to design a scale that we used in a cross-sectional study of 102 software developers. To test the proposed hypotheses, we conducted exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis. Our results highlight that happiness positively influences a team's behaviour and that unhappiness negatively affects their work results and productivity. These findings provide software companies and organisations with a better understanding of the importance of team behaviour on individual happiness during crises.

By emphasizing the need for a comprehensive value framework for design, the present study explores a new value framework to be used as a common ground in design. For this purpose, we empirically investigate how different people group human values. By spreading the link of our Human Values Survey worldwide via the internet, a variety of participants with different cultural backgrounds were reached, and hierarchical cluster analysis was used to analyze the data. As a result, 568 complete answers were collected, from which nine value groups were concluded: \u201ccarefulness\u201d, \u201cjustice\u201d, \u201cecology\u201d, \u201crespect for others\u201d, \u201cmeaningfulness\u201d, \u201cstatus\u201d, \u201cpleasure\u201d, \u201crespect for oneself\u201d and \u201cpersonal development\u201d.

This leads both proponents and opponents of liberalism to argue that liberalism involves allowing individuals to determine for themselves the level of privacy they desire. If they are given adequate information and the ability to choose, the results are argued to be legitimate, even if individuals choose to bargain away all or most of their privacy in return for convenience, economic benefits, etc. However, the individualistic approach to privacy is insufficient, due to a set of externalities and information leakages involved in privacy issues. A crucial aspect of privacy is that it is an aggregate public good, and recognising this lets us see why government intervention is both beneficial and necessary for securing the provision of optimal levels of privacy. This conception of privacy enables us to treat it as a good that is underprovided due to market failure.

Thus, in this paper we present a constructive analysis of values in eGovernment that aims to clarify the complexity around the matter. First, different levels and types of values affecting eGovernment are considered and then existing values guiding the governance of eGovernment are analysed. Based on these preliminary analyses it is noted, that there are some justified values, but more work is needed to create ethical governance model for eGovernment and data ecosystems that they are a part of to avoid failures and perhaps reach the goal of better society.", "venue": "ICSOB", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "41030330", "name": "Minna M.

However, bioeconomic transformation is not necessarily sustainable. To design effective enabling and regulatory governance frameworks for bio-based transformation, policy makers have to identify potentially game-changing future technologies and assess associated sustainability gains and risks. Drawing on the concept of key enabling technologies (KETs) put forward by the European Commission (EC) in 2009, this paper defines KETs for the bioeconomy. Based on an international expert survey, we identified KET criteria for bioeconomic transformation and developed overarching super-categories describing technology pathways and criteria dimensions according to the existing society\u2013environment\u2013economy triangle. In this way, this study contributes not only in providing advice allowing new technologies to foster but also in elucidating relationships between the regional origin and the perceived future of bio-based technology development.

Existing business models and revenue streams in the automotive and transportation sector will be affected by this developing technology and a potential shift of societal mobility usage patterns. These disruptions will also have a far-reaching impact on the automotive aftersales service and motor insurance sector. Existing literature on the strategic impact of connected automated vehicles (CAV) for the motor insurance mostly focusses on questions of liability and the potential impact on the overall premium volume of the business. Enlarging this research focus with an analysis of service-based mobility approaches and the emergence of business ecosystem platforms in the automotive and mobility sectors, this paper finds that these developments have significant spillover effects on customer interfaces and the competitive environment of motor insurance. In particular, the ability of traditional motor insurers to integrate themselves in business ecosystem platforms built around CAV is disadvantaged due to a lack of an equal technical and legal access to in-vehicle data required for telematics-based services. Referring to this barrier, this research shows that the shift of the automobile to an interconnected smart device makes it necessary that automotive manufacturers (OEMs) open their business ecosystem platforms for third parties to maximize own value propositions. However, as this awareness seems not to be penetrated into adequate proactive action of OEMs, we suggest a timely intervention of legislative bodies to achieve the common regulatory objective of an undistorted and fair competition in telematics-based (insurance) service offerings.", "venue": "Technology in Society", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 91, "citationCount": 10, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "101301640", "name": "Fabian P\u00fctz"}, {"authorId": "47527467", "name": "Finbarr Murphy"}, {"authorId": "47086166", "name": "Martin Mullins"}, {"authorId": "1403306171", "name": "L.

These results show the ethical themes that were operative in such discussions: privacy, safety, enforceability, crime, nuisance and professionality. Underlying most of these themes is trust. We discuss this concept with respect to the good society, and we suggest that trust may be more critical to emerging technologies than technologies in general.

Providing an innovative way to help human society, enabling the achievement of good lives by evaluating information related to the concept of wisdom, this paper aims to propose technical guidelines as a reference model, specifically for empowering both professional and ethical bases associated with the instructional application strategy for adopting technology.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study attempts to investigate the professional and ethical engagements that can underlie technology adoption. To achieve this, a literature review of peer-reviewed journals, conferences and books was conducted to propose the framework model for strengthening moral engagement in the digital era. By using keywords derived from the professional and ethical skills involved with technology adoption, multiple research findings can be achieved using meta-synthesis alongside an integrating, evaluating and interpreting process. As a result, phenomenological and grounded theories and ideas, extracted to identify their common features, elements and functionalities, can be integrated and used to propose a theoretical guideline.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings reveal that to engage the professional and ethical bases associated with the instructional strategy and application in technology adoption demonstrates how humans, with all their potency, can contribute significantly to society at large by enhancing their abilities and improving their capacities for the wise and appropriate utilization of technological tools.\n\n\nPractical implications\nWith regard to experiences in the digital era, across differing cultures and age groups, based on emerging technology, it is necessary to use technological tools properly and wisely. An effort to foster positive outcomes as a result of increased digital media use, and address potential issues raised by empowering applications and strategies associated with professionalism and ethics, plays a significant role in contouring the main foundations for how to use technological tools in all the comprehensive coverage concerning the theory and applications addressed by this work.\n\n\nSocial implications\nWhat is significant and essential about the technological bases examined is their core element of enabling humans to enhance any benefits garnered for social and personal development. This paper intends to expand upon how professional and ethical aspects of technology adoption should involve a wide exchange of particular elements that underlie the wise and appropriate fostering of technological implementation.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nEmerging technology with its distinct facilities could enhance individual performance by improving abilities and capacities for wise and appropriate operation of technological tools. By critically exploring the professional and ethical balance involved with technology-based tools in society and how they might underpin their users\u2019 social and personal awareness, this paper gives feedback that provides insights about emerging technological trends.

Based on this framework, the paper explores the Exposition as a sociotechnical prototype, publicly enacted and experienced, and essential to insights about our own sociotechnical future.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 26, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "114380796", "name": "Ole Sneltvedt"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "c62bc114cfb33d036d125c8069d2cd7fed0833a9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2744047709", "DOI": "10.1016/J.TECHSOC.2017.07.009"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c62bc114cfb33d036d125c8069d2cd7fed0833a9", "title": "The requirement of accessibility: European automated border control systems for persons with disabilities", "abstract": "Abstract This exploratory study investigates whether automated border control systems should be provided for persons with disabilities at European airports. While the special assistance provided to disabled passengers has improved in the last decade, some may want to travel independently using automated gates. This is currently not possible, nor is there an explicit plan to include the accessibility requirement in future technology development. We reflect this questionable situation against the notion of the good society and consider airports as normatively laden socio-physical zones contributing to experiences of exclusion. Our research stresses the need to consider human abilities as a spectrum, which should be addressed with the use of universal design principles to benefit as many travelers as possible. Interviews and a survey of disabled passengers help us explore the views of stakeholders; to find out whether persons with disabilities wish to use automated systems instead of assistance services, and whether stakeholders consider accessible systems technologically possible, cost-effective, and recommendable.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46221373", "name": "A.

Building on Ivan Illich's systemic understanding of a convivial society, my secondary aim is to provide a matrix for the ethical design of technologies meant to foster conviviality. I will argue that such an ethical matrix could overcome strictly individualistic or holistic understandings of the social realm, by admitting that the social change provoked by technology is affecting both the social fabric of the concerned society and the individual which is part of the social structure concerned.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48884490", "name": "C.
