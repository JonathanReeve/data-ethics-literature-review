As we mark 15 years into the field of Internet studies, it becomes necessary to assess what the extant research tells us about race and racism. This paper provides an analysis of the literature on race and racism in Internet studies in the broad areas of (1) race and the structure of the Internet, (2) race and racism matters in what we do online, and (3) race, social control and Internet law. Then, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives, including Hall\u2019s spectacle of the Other and DuBois\u2019s view of white culture, the paper offers an analysis and critique of the field, in particular the use of racial formation theory. Finally, the paper points to the need for a critical understanding of whiteness in Internet studies.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 178, "citationCount": 264, "influentialCitationCount": 22, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46325253", "name": "Jessie Daniels"}]}
