We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data. This essay elaborates on the ways Big Data impacts on ethical conceptions.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 317, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3369464", "name": "A.
