Due to increased anxiety levels because of uncertainties, the paper provides a reflection of doctoral experiences from two students \u2013 one in Russia at the data collection stage, and one in China (enrolled in New Zealand) at the proposal stage.\n\nMethodology: Through collaborative autoethnography and joint-reflection, we analyze our experiences as doctoral students focusing on methodological adjustments, ethical dilemmas, adaptation strategies and supervisor-supervisee relationships. Conducting a collaborative autoethnography provides a richer analysis of the interplay between perspectives, compared to a traditional autoethnography. Collaborative autoethnography also provides conditions for a collective exploration of subjectivities of doctoral students through an iterative process. After providing separate individual accounts, we discussed our experiences, analyzed them, and engaged in a joint-reflection from our consensual interpretations.\n\nContribution: Our work aims to contribute to existing discussions on how COVID-19 impacted on doctoral students\u2019 coping strategies during the pandemic. The paper encourages doctoral students to further discuss how they navigate their doctoral experiences through autoethnography and joint-reflections.\n\nFindings: Three main themes transpired in our analysis. First, we encountered roadblocks such as interruptions, frustrations and resistance to adapt our doctoral studies in the pandemic context, which align with the recent literature regarding education during the coronavirus pandemic. Second, we faced a diversity of burdens and privileges in the pandemic, which provided us with both pleasant (opportunity to create change) and unpleasant (unknown threats) situations, thereby enabling us to construct and reconstruct our stories through reflection. Third, we experienced a shared unfamiliarity of doing doctoral studies during the pandemic, to which the role of the academic community including our supervisors and doctoral colleagues contributed to how we managed our circumstances. \n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: We speak to our fellow doctoral students to dare navigate their doctoral experiences through collaborative reflections. In practice, by reflecting on our experience, we recommend that new doctoral students remain flexible and mindful of their doctoral journeys and recognize their agency to deal with the unexpected. We thus encourage the view of doctoral studies as a process rather than outcome-oriented, as we gain experience from processes. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: We recommend using both collaborative autoethnography and joint-reflection as an instructive tool for qualitative research. Such engagements offer important discussions towards further communications and exchange of ideas among doctoral students from various backgrounds.\n\nImpact on Society: More broadly, this work is an invitation to reflect and provoke further thoughts to articulate reflections on the impact and various ways of thinking that the pandemic might bring to the fore.\n\nFuture Research: Doctoral students are welcome to contribute to a collectivity of narratives that thicken the data and analyses of their pandemic experiences in higher education to reinforce the role of doctoral researchers as agents of history in the trying times of a pandemic.\n\n", "venue": "International Journal of Doctoral Studies", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 94, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2133247001", "name": "Aireen Grace Andal"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Shuang Wu"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "41b3a0e954ab7b6471b2830e8d13a9e1a31fafb5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3162142080", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jnma.2021.04.002", "PubMed": "33992432"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41b3a0e954ab7b6471b2830e8d13a9e1a31fafb5", "title": "Addressing the gate blocking of minority faculty.", "abstract": "There have been ongoing efforts to increase the presence of underrepresented minorities in medicine (URMM), including faculty development initiatives, mentoring programs and outreach efforts.

Evidence: Imposterism has been associated with, but not demonstrated to be causative of, psychological conditions including stress, shame, guilt, and burnout, and behaviors such as \u201chiding out,\u201d which impede career development. The authors argue that to avoid these more serious potential manifestations of imposterism, the approach to imposterism should be reframed, and medical students, residents, and physicians should be helped to view episodic feelings of imposterism as appropriate situational responses.

Using Writing Accountability Groups (WAG), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded Obesity Health Disparities (OHD) PRIDE is one of the few research training and mentoring programs that places an equal focus on scientific writing and grant writing. This article reports on the utility of WAGs for OHD PRIDE mentees.\n\n\nMethod\nParticipants included 14 of 26 individuals who were fellows in the OHD PRIDE research training and mentoring program. A typical WAG has between four and eight members who meet for one hour each week over a 10-week period and commit a priori to attend at least 70% of the sessions. Summary statistics were produced to characterize number of peer-reviewed publications, grants, years in academic rank, and category of current academic rank, barriers to frequency of writing, and duration of writing. Results from pre- and post-WAG surveys were compared to determine the overall impact of the WAG. The study period discussed in this article took place between January and December 2017 and included data from three 10-week cycles beginning in February, May, and September.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-three percent of OHD PRIDE participants successfully completed at least one 10-week WAG cycle. The WAGs did not have a statistically significant impact on either the frequency of writing or the duration of writing. However, the majority of the participants who successfully completed at least one WAG cycle reported that they either maintained or increased their frequency or duration of writing.\n\n\nConclusion\nBy providing a structured approach to developing and/or enhancing a practice of consistent writing, time management skills, and collaborative relationships, the WAG has promise for enhancing scientific writing skills for many trainees and early-career faculty.

Many U.S. states and the executive boards of businesses have incorporated them into their constitutions and bylaws; however, studies in politics and business have shown that implementing term limits has mixed results. Specifically, research in politics has shown that terms limits have had a minimal effect on the number of women and minorities elected to office, while research in business indicates term limits do increase innovation. Additionally, term limits may have unintended negative consequences, including inhibiting individuals from developing deep expertise in a specific area of interest and destabilizing institutions that endure frequent turnover in leaders. Given this conflicting information, it is not surprising that AMCs in the United States have not widely incorporated term limits for those holding positions of power, including deans, presidents, provosts and department heads. Notably, a few academic medical centers (AMCs) have incorporated such limits for some positions, and faculty have viewed these positively for their ability to shape a more egalitarian and collaborative culture. Drawing on studies from academic medicine, politics, and business, the author examines arguments both for and against instituting term limits at AMCs. The author concludes that despite strong arguments against term limits, they deserve attention in academic medicine, especially given their potential to help address gender and racial disparities and to encourage innovation.", "venue": "Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "29012472", "name": "J.

As leaders in academic medicine, we have collated several structured recommendations for physicians of both genders seeking to be better mentors to female trainees and early career physicians. We discuss each of these recommendations in detail including the following: acknowledging your own strengths and limitations as a mentor, addressing issues of work-life integration, helping your mentee set long-term career goals, and acting as a sponsor as well as a mentor.
