Social justice can support these goals by serving as a topic of inquiry in LIS curricula as well as by providing a scholarly framework for understanding how power and privilege shape LIS institutions and professional practice. This article applies social justice as a topic and tool for transforming LIS curricula and culture by exploring the implementation of social justice\u2013themed courses and an extracurricular reading group in one LIS department. Exploring curricular and extracurricular cases in a shared institutional setting contextualizes key challenges and conversations that can inform similar initiatives in other institutions. Transforming LIS culture to prioritize social justice values, epistemologies, and frameworks requires multivalent strategies, community buy-in, and shared responsibility in terms of the labor of leading and sustaining engagement with social justice.", "venue": "The Library Quarterly", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 67, "citationCount": 46, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "16174103", "name": "Nicole A.
