Being able to see a system is sometimes equated with being able to know how it works and govern it\u2014a pattern that recurs in recent work about transparency and computational systems. But can \u201cblack boxes\u2019 ever be opened, and if so, would that ever be sufficient? In this article, we critically interrogate the ideal of transparency, trace some of its roots in scientific and sociotechnical epistemological cultures, and present 10 limitations to its application. We specifically focus on the inadequacy of transparency for understanding and governing algorithmic systems and sketch an alternative typology of algorithmic accountability grounded in constructive engagements with the limitations of transparency ideals.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 96, "citationCount": 494, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2151275", "name": "Mike Ananny"}, {"authorId": "48024382", "name": "K.
