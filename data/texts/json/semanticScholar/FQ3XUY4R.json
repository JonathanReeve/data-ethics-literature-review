Algorithmic power and the threat of invisibility on Facebook", "abstract": "This article explores the new modalities of visibility engendered by new media, with a focus on the social networking site Facebook. Influenced by Foucault\u2019s writings on Panopticism \u2013 that is, the architectural structuring of visibility \u2013 this article argues for understanding the construction of visibility on Facebook through an architectural framework that pays particular attention to underlying software processes and algorithmic power. Through an analysis of EdgeRank, the algorithm structuring the flow of information and communication on Facebook\u2019s \u2018News Feed\u2019, I argue that the regime of visibility constructed imposes a perceived \u2018threat of invisibility\u2019 on the part of the participatory subject. As a result, I reverse Foucault\u2019s notion of surveillance as a form of permanent visibility, arguing that participatory subjectivity is not constituted through the imposed threat of an all-seeing vision machine, but by the constant possibility of disappearing and becoming obsolete.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 600, "influentialCitationCount": 51, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38516982", "name": "Taina Bucher"}]}
