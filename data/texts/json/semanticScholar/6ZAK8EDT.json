This study draws on 19 months of participant-observation research at a software firm to investigate how relations between workers and technology evolved over three phases of the company\u2019s development. The author finds two forms of human\u2013software complementarity: computational labor that supports or stands in for software algorithms and emotional labor aimed at helping users adapt to software systems. Instead of perfecting software algorithms that would progressively push people out of the production process, managers continually reconfigured assemblages of software and human helpers, developing new forms of organization with a dynamic relation to technology. The findings suggest how the dynamism of the organizations in which software algorithms are produced and implemented will contribute to labor\u2019s enduring relevance in the digital age.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 105, "citationCount": 43, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "101739970", "name": "Benjamin Shestakofsky"}]}
