Abuses of power by Internet platforms have led to calls for algorithm transparency and regulation. Algorithms have a particularly problematic history of processing information about race. Yet some analysts have warned that foundational computer algorithms are not useful subjects for ethical or normative analysis due to complexity, secrecy, technical character, or generality. We respond by investigating what it is an analyst needs to know to determine whether the algorithm in a computer system is improper, unethical, or illegal in itself. We argue that an \u201calgorithmic ethics\u201d can analyze a particular published algorithm. We explain the importance of developing a practical algorithmic ethics that addresses virtues, consequences, and norms: We increasingly delegate authority to algorithms, and they are fast becoming obscure but important elements of social structure.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 61, "citationCount": 74, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1829115", "name": "Christian Sandvig"}, {"authorId": "2072368141", "name": "Kevin Hamilton"}, {"authorId": "1680270", "name": "K.
