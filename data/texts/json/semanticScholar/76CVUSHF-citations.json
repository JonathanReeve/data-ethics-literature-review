These structural properties also engrain the concomitant use of two forms of communication. The first of which involves private signals between firms with direct connections to each other, signals which go from specific senders to specific recipients.

As a measure of the degree of uncertainty involved in translation choices, HTra reflects translation ambiguity and has been used as a predictor variable for the cognitive effort in the translator\u2019s selection of a TT item among the co-activated alternatives. In this regard, the present chapter starts from a theoretical discussion on entropy, lexical activation, cognitive effort, and the dynamic change of entropy in the mental processes of the translation choice, exploring the conceptual basis on which entropy can represent cognitive load and describe the assumed mental states, in translation. It then examines in an empirical manner the entropy values (i.e., HTra) of the words which are fixated in AUs on the basis of the CRITT TPR-DB, to shed light on the manner in which contextual information is cognitively processed. Results show that the AUs which are associated with the resolution of problems arising from high-entropy words tend to include scanpaths where low-entropy words come into play, which indicates that the cognitive processing of a highly translation-ambiguous item is facilitated by the contextual information which is provided by items of low translation-ambiguity levels.

In doing so, we use the work of Randall Collins and his state breakdown model to exemplify that, already today, AI-based models can help synthesise knowledge from a variety of sources, reason about the world, and apply what is known across a wide range of problems in a systematic way. However, we also find that AI-driven social theory remains subject to a range of practical, technical, and epistemological limitations. Most critically, existing AI-systems lack three essential capabilities needed to advance social theory in ways that are cumulative, holistic, open-ended, and purposeful. These are (1) semanticisation, i.e., the ability to develop and operationalize verbal concepts to represent machine-manipulable knowledge; (2) transferability, i.e., the ability to transfer what has been learned in one context to another; and (3) generativity, i.e., the ability to independently create and improve on concepts and models.

Responses by governments in charge of public health, and all other involved organizations, have proved largely wanting. Data infrastructure and the information and communication systems needed to deal with the pandemic have likewise not been up to the task. Nevertheless, after a year of the worldwide outbreak, hope arises from this being the first major pandemic event in history where genomic and related biosciences \u2013 relying on biomedical informatics \u2013 have been essential in decoding the viral sequence data and producing the mRNA and other biotechnologies that unexpectedly rapidly have led to investigation, design, development, and testing of useful vaccines. Medical informatics may also help support public health actions and clinical interventions - but scalability and impact will depend on overcoming ingrained human shortcomings to deal with complex socio-economic, political, and technological disruptions together with the many ethical challenges presented by pandemics. Objectives : The principal goal is to review the history of biomedical information and healthcare practices related to past pandemics in order to illustrate just how exceptional and dependent on biomedical informatics are the recent scientific insights into human immune responses to viral infection, which are enabling rapid antiviral vaccine development and clinical management of severe cases \u2013 despite the many societal challenges ahead. Methods : This paper briefly reviews some of the key historical antecedents leading up to modern insights into epidemic and pandemic processes with their biomedical and healthcare information intended to guide practitioners, agencies, and the lay public in today\u2019s ongoing pandemic events. Conclusions : Poor scientific understanding and excessively slow learning about infectious disease processes and mitigating behaviors have stymied effective treatment until the present time. Advances in insights about immune systems, genomes, proteomes, and all the other -omes, became a reality thanks to the key sequencing technologies and biomedical informatics that enabled the Human Genome Project, and only now, 20 years later, are having an impact in ameliorating devastating zoonotic infectious pandemics, including the present SARS-CoV-2 event through unprecedently rapid vaccine development. In the future these advances will hopefully also enable more targeted prevention and treatment of disease. However, past and present shortcomings of most of the COVID-19 pandemic responses illustrate just how difficult it is to persuade enough people \u2013 and especially political leaders \u2013 to adopt societally beneficial risk-avoidance behaviors and policies, even as these become better understood.", "venue": "Yearbook of medical informatics", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 173, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3285789", "name": "C.

AI, the suite of techniques intended to make machines capable of performing tasks considered \u2018intelligent\u2019 when performed by people, is an epochal technology now colonizing an increasing number of domains, from Internet search and social media to the natural and social sciences; agriculture, banking, criminal sentencing, decision-making, and beyond. AI may soon become ubiquitous, coextensive with technological civilization itself: a taken-for-granted feature of modernity like running water or electricity. But this does not mean that all is well. While AI promises to liberate and empower users, improve well-being, support social institutions, and enable sustainable development, it also threatens to automate and entrench precarity and illiberalism, degrademental health, and accelerate the Earth\u2019s ecological collapse. Freud (1961) famously observed that civilization, despite being ostensibly intended to protect humanity from misery, is paradoxically a great source of unhappiness. Similarly, AI is both touted as the solution to humanity\u2019s biggest problems and decried as one of the biggest problems humankind has ever faced \u2013 even, perhaps, its last.

The combination of big data with powerful means of pattern matching is leading to many more instances where the resulting outputs have a real-world impact on learning environments. For example, recently the UK government used an algorithm to calculate the grades of all schoolchildren when the Covid 19 pandemic disrupted summer exams. This very large-scale application of AI was subject to intense scrutiny by the young students, their parents and teachers and was found wanting. This editorial seeks to review the mission of the Journal of Interactive Learning Environments (ILE) in the context of AI and algorithms. This is a useful endeavour as there is a growing recognition of the potential harms, and risks, of the application of AI. These potential harms range from surveillance capitalism, which facilitates the ever more intrusive and intense targeting of commercial content; to systems of citizen control, which use video surveillance as a means of scrutiny, and even subjugation, of populations.

Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges. For example, ADMS may produce discriminatory outcomes, violate individual privacy, and undermine human self-determination. New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define EBA as a structured process whereby an entity\u2019s present or past behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant principles or norms. We then offer three contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting procedural regularity and transparency. Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully. Third, we identify and discuss the conceptual, technical, social, economic, organisational, and institutional constraints associated with EBA.

In this paper, we examine the vagueness in debates about the safety and ethical behavior of AI systems. We show how this vagueness cannot be resolved through mathematical formalism alone, instead requiring deliberation about the politics of development as well as the context of deployment. Drawing from a new sociotechnical lexicon, we redefine vagueness in terms of distinct design challenges at key stages in AI system development. The resulting framework of Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) empowers developers by 1) identifying points of overlap between design decisions and major sociotechnical challenges; 2) motivating the creation of stakeholder feedback channels so that safety issues can be exhaustively addressed. As such, HCAI contributes to a timely debate about the status of AI development in democratic societies, arguing that deliberation should be the goal of AI Safety, not just the procedure by which it is ensured.", "venue": "Artif.

However just like all non-convex optimization problems, tuning the PID algorithm for accurate and stable closed-loop control becomes a NP-Hard Problem. This leads to a dilemma, for both users and designers, most especially in practise. It is then no wonder that tuning software is a big business in the industrial automation sector. In this review, we present and classify PID tuning methods till date into three general areas. Finally, we then present a proposal to minimize the dilemma of complexity and cost that has become associated with tuning the three main parameters of the PID control law.

Reorganization of primary health and mental health services took place with late and inadequate national guidelines or coordination.

After Turing\u2019s work on the Logical Computing Machine (1936\u20131950) and Shannon\u2019s theory (1948), Brillouin attributed information content to Maxwell\u2019s demon\u2019s action (1956), with a scientific invention and, in my opinion, a touch of humor, thus granting to inert matter an intelligent activity capable of inverting entropy. Moreover, since the 1950s, many identified the digital elaboration of data with human intelligence and some projected the processing of information onto inert matter. In the same years, DNA was identified as the complete information carrier of phylogenesis and ontogenesis. In these approaches, an ambiguity has been arbitrarily played out, and a threshold has been sometimes crossed, sometimes not; first, in Logic and Computing, between \u201cformal principles of proof\u201d or of computation and their \u201csemantics\u201d (their mathematical meaning); then in Biology, between elaboration of information and biological dynamics in their context. Today, well beyond classical Artificial Intelligence on discrete data types, Brillouin\u2019s invention and Deep Learning on continuous mathematical structures are the new loci of confusion between knowledge construction and transmission or processing of information. Yet, the construction of human knowledge is even more radically by-passed and science dehumanized when information is directly embedded in a world that is viewed as a massive information processor. The remarkable scientific and economic productivity of our new observable, information, must instead be seen in the context of our human, ecosystemic and historical activities, in order to subordinate it to interpretation and meaningful action that enrich and do not strip the sense from our forms of knowledge and life.

Analogously, but in a purely computational realm, machine learning algorithms seek to estimate models that capture predictable structure and identify irrelevant noise in training data by optimizing performance measures, such as a model's log-likelihood of having generated the data. Is there a sense in which these computational models are physically preferred? For adaptive physical systems we introduce the organizing principle that thermodynamic work is the most relevant performance measure of advantageously modeling an environment. Specifically, a physical agent's model determines how much useful work it can harvest from an environment. We show that when such agents maximize work production they also maximize their environmental model's log-likelihood, establishing an equivalence between thermodynamics and learning.

These considerations have particular importance in design science research (DSR) projects since the developed artifacts often actively intervene into human affairs and, thus, cannot be free from value. To account for this fact, Myers and Venable (2014) proposed six ethical principles for DSR in order to support researchers to conduct ethical DSR. However, ethical principles per se\u2014and the ethical DSR principles that Myers and Venable proposed\u2014 have an abstract nature so that they can apply to a broad range of contexts. As a consequence, they do not necessarily apply to specific research projects, which means researchers need to contextualize them for each specific DSR project. Because doing so involves much challenge, we explore how contemporary DSR publications have dealt with this contextualization task and how they have implemented the six ethical principles for DSR. Our results reveal that DSR publications have not discussed ethical principles in sufficient depth. To further promote ethical considerations in DSR, we argue that both DSR researchers and reviewers should be supported in implementing ethical principles. Therefore, we outline two pathways toward ethical DSR. First, we propose that researchers need to articulate the next generation of ethical principles for DSR using prescriptive knowledge structures from DSR. Second, we propose extending established DSR conceptualizations with an ethical dimension and specifically introduce the concept of ethical DSR process models.

Nature no longer exists as the environment for human evolution. Human beings evolve autonomously in the environment constructed using technology. Human beings evolve in the exo-Darwinian system. From this perspective, Simondon explains a concept that comes from the relationship between technology and culture, called \u2018automaticity.\u2019 He paid attention to the fact that the true automaticity of machines does not relate to the increased automation of physical processes and the intimate combination of machines but to the inclusion of indeterminacy and creation of a network with human beings. His reflection on such sensitivity and automaticity of machines is a valid philosophical approach to robots. The open machine structure refers to the enhancement of automaticity. The automaticity of robots does not enhance exclusive automaticity by confronting human beings. It refers to the evolution of the network structure formed with human beings.

The past as it really happened. History shorn of petty bias and human foible. Forever and ever. Amen. Or so predicted an article in the Journal of American History in 1967. In \u201cComputers and Historical Studies,\u201d Jerome M. Clubb and Howard Allen declared that intellectual habits would change, for the better, as computers were increasingly relied upon in historical research and writing. With a certain optimism in the \u201crich potentialities of electronic data processing equipment\u201d for humanistic research, they predicted that a new kind of sober empiricism would take hold in the historian\u2019s relationship to the past. An unprecedented scientific rigor would be enabled. A bigger, convincing picture would provide proper context and right meaning to those singular events, lives, and words described by the historian. \u201cComputers facilitate generalization, and historians become increasingly concerned with the common properties of human affairs and less concerned with supposedly unique and transitory occurrences, however dramatic they may be.\u201d The past could be known to the degree that it could be stabilized, shorn of jagged and statistically insignificant edges. Uniqueness was indecipherable. But sameness lent itself to quantification. Data points providing leverage for building scale into an ever expanding explanations of the past.

Objective This paper begins by arguing that TSN is a useful and viable approach to chronic disease self-care. The analysis then focuses on the empirical research question of testing and demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of prototype TSN supplied to patients with the typical complex chronic disease of coexisting type 2 diabetes and hypertension. At the policy level, it is shown that the data allow for a calibration of TSN technology augmentation, which can be readily applied to health care management. Methods A 24-week, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed and implemented among diabetic and hypertensive outpatients in two Hong Kong public hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group, supplied with a tablet-based TSN app prototype, or to a conventional self-managing control group. Primary indices\u2014hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure\u2014and secondary indices were measured at baseline and at 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks after initiation, after which the data were applied to test TSN effectiveness and safety. Results A total of 299 participating patients were randomized to the intervention group (n=151) or the control group (n=148). Statistically significant outcomes that directly indicated TSN effectiveness in terms of hemoglobin 1c were found in both groups but not with regard to systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These findings also offered indirect empirical support for TSN safety. Statistically significant comparative changes in these primary indices were not observed between the groups but were suggestive of an operational calibration of TSN technology augmentation. Statistically significant changes in secondary indices were obtained in one or both groups, but not between the groups. Conclusions The RCT\u2019s strong behavioral basis, as well as the importance of safety and effectiveness when complex chronic illness is proximately self-managed by layperson patients, prompted the formulation of the empirical joint hypothesis that TSN would improve patient self-care while satisfying the condition of patient self-safety. Statistical and decision analysis applied to the experimental outcomes offered support for this hypothesis. Policy relevance of the research is demonstrated by the derivation of a data-grounded operational calibration of TSN technology augmentation with ready application to health care management.

Hence, it has become important to improve public understanding of science with a focus on explaining the nature of uncertainty in science and its impacts. The goal of the present study was to explore pre-service teachers\u2019 analysis of claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout an 8-week online implementation of a pre-service teachers\u2019 analysis task, focus group interviews, and instructor\u2019s feedback to this analysis in a course focusing on critical and analytical thinking. In order to achieve this purpose, the researchers used the claims that contain fallacies, conspiracy theories, and scientific arguments related to the COVID-19 pandemic as an assessment tool. The researchers developed and used a rubric consisting of the high, moderate, and low levels of analysis in three different categories including evaluation of claims, demarcation of fallacies and conspiracy theories from scientific arguments, and judgment of the credibility of sources. The findings indicate that the participants analyzed the claims rarely at a high level before the focus group interviews. However, after the focus group interviews, almost every participant\u2019s analysis scores of evaluation, demarcation, and judgment increased. The results also revealed their commitment to various fallacies and conspiracy theories while arguing the claims.

Fuelled by both public and private investment, military technology is accelerating towards increasingly autonomous weapons, as well as the merging of humans and machines. Contrary to much of the contemporary debate, this is not a paradigm change; it is the intensification of a central feature in the relationship between technology and war: double elevation, above one\u2019s enemy and above oneself. Elevation above one\u2019s enemy aspires to spatial, moral, and civilizational distance. Elevation above oneself reflects a belief in rational improvement that sees humanity as the cause of inhumanity and de-humanization as our best chance for humanization. The distance of double elevation is served by the mechanization of judgement. To the extent that judgement is seen as reducible to algorithm, law becomes the handmaiden of mechanization. In response, neither a focus on questions of compatibility nor a call for a \u2018ban on killer robots\u2019 help in articulating a meaningful role for law. Instead, I argue that we should turn to a long-standing philosophical critique of artificial intelligence, which highlights not the threat of omniscience, but that of impoverished intelligence. Therefore, if there is to be a meaningful role for law in resisting double elevation, it should be law encompassing subjectivity, emotion and imagination, law irreducible to algorithm, a law of war that appreciates situated judgement in the wielding of violence for the collective.", "venue": "Leiden Journal of International Law", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 135, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3117633", "name": "Ioannis Kalpouzos"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "9626001cdbd18398ec8d1f4057ae6f6c2de3664f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3036656219", "DOI": "10.5772/intechopen.89153"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9626001cdbd18398ec8d1f4057ae6f6c2de3664f", "title": "Semiotic Architecture of Viral Data", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2126781878", "name": "Berna Leticia Valle Canales"}, {"authorId": "2126778972", "name": "Julio C\u00e9sar Chavarr\u00eda Hernandez"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "9b2470bc04d292041e3d2c11ba47988ca2c4fe1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3155978631", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3750608"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b2470bc04d292041e3d2c11ba47988ca2c4fe1e", "title": "Natural Cybernetics of Time, or about the Half of any Whole", "abstract": "Norbert Wiener\u2019s idea of \u201ccybernetics\u201d is linked to temporality as in a physical as in a philosophical sense. \u201cTime orders\u201d can be the slogan of that natural cybernetics of time: time orders by itself in its \u201cscreen\u201d in virtue of being a well-ordering valid until the present moment and dividing any totality into two parts: the well-ordered of the past and the yet unordered of the future therefore sharing the common boundary of the present between them when the ordering is taking place by choices. Thus, the quantity of information defined by units of choices, whether bits or qubits, describes that process of ordering happening in the present moment. The totality (which can be considered also as a particular or \u201cregional\u201d totality) turns out to be divided into two parts: the internality of the past and the externality of the future by the course of time, but identifiable to each other in virtue of scientific transcendentalism (e.g. mathematical, physical, and historical transcendentalism). A properly mathematical approach to the \u201ctotality and time\u201d is introduced by the abstract concept of \u201cevolutionary tree\u201d (i.e. regardless of the specific nature of that to which refers: such as biological evolution, Feynman trajectories, social and historical development, etc.), Then, the other half of the future can be represented as a deformed mirror image of the evolutionary tree taken place already in the past: therefore the past and future part are seen to be unifiable as a mirrorly doubled evolutionary tree and thus representable as generalized Feynman trajectories. The formalism of the separable complex Hilbert space (respectively, the qubit Hilbert space) applied and further elaborated in quantum mechanics in order to uniform temporal and reversible, discrete and continuous processes is relevant. Then, the past and future parts of evolutionary tree would constitute a wave function (or even only a single qubit once the concept of actual infinity be involved to real processes). Each of both parts of it, i.e. either the future evolutionary tree or its deformed mirror image, would represented a \u201chalf of the whole\u201d.

These results bridge the gap between opinion dynamics and evolutionary game theory. With the aid of this bridge, we transform the in-group bias opinion dynamics on evolving networks, where individuals are likely to keep a steady relationship with those holding similar opinions, to the coordination game on the complete network; and the out-group bias opinion dynamics to the coexistence game.

In particular, I follow a group of intellectuals known as the Groupe des dix, who, in the aftermath of the tumult of May \u201868, formed an interdisciplinary think tank to try to work out how to bridge the gap between science and society. In order to facilitate conversations between politicians, philosophers, biologists, and sociologists (to name just a few of the represented disciplines), the Groupe reached for a language that was supposed to be truly omnidisciplinary: that of cybernetics. And they did so in a country where cybernetics was not properly represented as a laboratory science. On this last point, this paper makes an addition to the history of cybernetics by offering a portrait not of cybernetics in action, but of cybernetics in vulgarization.

The paper analyzes archival material and first-hand accounts with the Geromat III, as well as the social context of federal funding for research into computing and education in West Germany of the 1960s, in order to understand how this teaching machine, an early form of computer-aided instruction (CAI), came to be. The Geromat III, though utilized on a small scale, found an audience of enthusiastic supporters on the other side of the country, with artist-designers at the Ulm School of Design who created prototypes for consoles to be used with the system. While hands-on knowledge about the system was unavailable to the console designers, an ideological affinity between the Ulm School of Design and the Berlin Institute for Cybernetics bridged any technical gaps in knowledge; the resulting design prototypes, one for mass-production and one for DIY (do-it-yourself) construction, point to speculative futures for the system.", "venue": "IEEE Annals of the History of Computing", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2064355539", "name": "Corinna Kirsch"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "bbde3fc69222c5724d78e8880add5f4f429d7dd3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3041772126", "DBLP": "conf/hci/Rafael20", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-49713-2_36"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbde3fc69222c5724d78e8880add5f4f429d7dd3", "title": "Multimodality, Naturalness and Transparency in Affective Computing for HCI", "abstract": "Post-industrial society, aligned with the model of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, has been providing technological advances in advanced robotics, IoT, self-driving vehicles, non-biological sentient life development, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning or cognitive computing, among others.

In the past century, the doctor\u2013patient relationship has changed considerably, shifting from a paternalistic, physician-dominated approach to a more dynamic and patient-centered. In such a context, effective communication skills have become even more crucial for good medical practice and most accreditation organizations urge medical schools to teach and evaluate communication skills. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Baghdad Teaching Hospital's three major departments (Surgery, Medicine, Obs/ Gyne). The final sample included 270 participants. A factor analysis was performed and generated two dimensions (\"interpersonal\" and \"content\"). Statistical differences between the groups and between the two dimensions of the questionnaire were analysed through t-tests and ANOVA. In addition, a multiple linear regression model was used to study the effect of some variables on the dependent variable \"communication\". Results The study showed a significant difference between \u201cinterpersonal\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d communication, with patients reporting higher satisfaction for the former. Reported satisfaction rates varied amongst the three departments with the Surgery specialty scoring significantly lower than the Medicine and the Obs/Gyne department. The duration of care under the current physician, a higher rank of specialty and the settings (inpatients versus outpatients) were positively and significantly associated with a higher quality of communication skills.

Rather, since his interpretation of the cybernetic concept of programme, he had been concerned with a conception of machines that takes account of their hypercomplexity \u2013 that is, of the semiotic and grammatological element implicit in them. According to Derrida, this element provides us with the analogical and general code of the biological and the cultural and thus with the protocol for telling a nonhumanist and differential history of life. In particular, this article explains that the grammatological conception of the cybernetic programme undergirds the re-elaboration of the relation between the biological and the psychical as well as of the Cartesian legacy underpinning the modern thought of the Animal, which Derrida develops in his unpublished seminar La Vie la mort and in his late essays on animality, respectively.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6023307", "name": "M.

Instead of just seeing ourselves in control, it is time to consider how these technologies actually control our moving bodies and transform our lived spaces. By shifting the focus from devices to choreographies among devices, we perform a theoretical analysis of the multidimensional aspects that reside within embodied interaction with technology. We suggest that it is beneficial to acknowledge and reformulate the phenomena of embodied control that go beyond the instrumental user-to-device control scheme. Drawing upon the phenomenology of the body, ecological psychology, and embodied cognitive science, we identify three different dimensions of embodied control: instrumental, experiential, and infrastructural.

The concept of sustainability is key to the functioning of the banking system as a complex economic system. It is noted that the stability of the system implies its flexibility to the influence of external factors and the ability to maintain a stable state (homeostasis). The concept of \u00abstability\u00bb of the system is closely linked with such concepts as \u00abvariability\u00bb, \u00abequilibrium\u00bb, \u00absustainable development\u00bb, \u00abcontrollability\u00bb, \u00abnon-equilibrium\u00bb, \u00abstable equilibrium\u00bb, which necessitates the simultaneous study of them. The expediency of studying the stability of the banking system at the macro level (adaptive stability and substitution stability) and micro level is substantiated. The features of statistical and dynamic types of stability of the banking system are singled out.It is proposed to interpret the essence of the economic equilibrium of the banking system as its ability to maintain its initial state for a long period of time, provided that there are no disturbing influences, or their unchanged parameters. The necessity of isolating the concepts of \u00absteady state of equilibrium\u00bb and \u00abunstable equilibrium\u00bb of the banking system is proved.It is emphasized that the stability of the functioning of banking under the synergetic approach is related to the process of self-organization, which suggests to understand the process of formation of new structures on the basis of the existing positive feedback. The emphasis is placed on the fact that the internal mechanism for ensuring the stability of the banking system is the dominance of negative feedback relationships over positive feedback.It is argued that the non-equilibrium is the process of self-organization of the banking system as a result of the prevalence of positive feedback relationships over negative feedback systems of the system. The main identifying features of the banking system from the standpoint of the synergetic approach are outlined: complexity, dynamism, nonlinearity, openness, adaptability, coherence, non-equilibrium and the ability to self-organize. The instability of the banking system is a logical continuation of its non-linearity and openness it was emphasized.", "venue": "Financial and credit activity: problems of theory and practice", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 13, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2130091937", "name": "P.
