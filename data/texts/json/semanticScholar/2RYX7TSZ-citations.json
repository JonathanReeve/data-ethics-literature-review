In a short time, it was an explosion of tweets related to the hashtag #coronavirus on Twitter. With the aim of reconstructing the meanings of the hashtag and the content, in terms of sentiment and opinions, of the reactions of the Italians, we collected in a large size corpus, the hundred thousand Italian tweets containing the #coronavirus produced during the media hype period from the Twitter repository (February 24th - 28th, 2020). Media hype period was discovered by digging in the online articles of \u2018la Repubblica', based on the presence of the words: coronavirus and Italy. The media hype is February 26th. The corpus underwent Emotional Text Mining (ETM), an unsupervised methodology, which allows social profiling based on communication. The study of the word chosen to talk about a topic and their co-occurrence allows the understanding of people\u2019s symbolizations, representations, and sentiment, about the coronavirus.

Faculty-based advising has been widely adopted by several community colleges because it results in a better advising experience for a student. However, due to lack of resources, outdated technologies, and growing diverse student population, the process increases the workload on already overwhelmed faculty. The role of technology in different areas of education sector is being slowly adopted, for instance, to provide various services such as online classes, registration services, and classwork maintenance. Despite these advancements, it is not being used for the purpose of academic advising. In this thesis, we discuss how machine learning (ML) and other technologies can be used to assist with faculty-based academic advising in higher education planning. The Virtual Academic Advisor (VAA) is an initial software solution to address this problem. Various ML-based techniques such as supervised learning, natural text processing, collaborative filtering, and sequence classification are explored to provide new functionality for the VAA. Collaborative filtering is used to give a recommendation of study plans based on a set of input parameters. Sequence Classification is used to predict possible suitable college majors, based on the course work designated for a student. In addition, we propose a strategy to generate synthetic data, necessary because it is nearly impossible to collect copious amount of real observations necessary for properly training ML-based modules. These various approaches will be integrated into the VAA system, to help faculty with the advising process, saving time for more meaningful conversations with students, and providing students with the ability to explore different educational paths.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 72, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1581197101", "name": "Sri Venkata Bhavani Likitha Vijjapu"}]}}, {"contexts": ["An image folksonomy such as Flickr is a framework where users can freely assign tags to their uploaded images [63], [64]."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "34300a660914c563fc56089251222ba099dbffe2", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/access/HamanoOH18", "MAG": "2776547528", "DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2786218"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34300a660914c563fc56089251222ba099dbffe2", "title": "A Language-Independent Ontology Construction Method Using Tagged Images in Folksonomy", "abstract": "This paper presents a language-independent ontology (LION) construction method that uses tagged images in an image folksonomy. Existing multilingual frameworks that construct an ontology deal with concepts translated on the basis of parallel corpora, which are not always available; however, the proposed method enables LION construction without parallel corpora by using visual features extracted from tagged images as the alternative. In the proposed method, visual similarities in tagged images are leveraged to aggregate synonymous concepts across languages. The aggregated concepts take on intrinsic semantics of themselves, while they also hold distinct characteristics in different languages. Then relationships between concepts are extracted on the basis of visual and textual features. The proposed method constructs a LION whose nodes and edges correspond to the aggregated concepts and relationships between them, respectively. The LION enables successful image retrieval across languages since each of the aggregated concepts can be referred to in different languages.

The choice of the appropriate elements for a user interface may result in a better experience of how it can be used. However, most studies investigate people\u2019s preferences and visual aesthetics, without taking into account people\u2019s emotion in the design. This dissertation carries out a series of detailed studies on the emotional effects of user interface elements, by examining colors, fonts and images. A critical analysis of the literature (through a systematic review) combined to the Semantic Space of Emotions, which covers a broad spectrum of emotions, resulted in the proposal of Bianchi\u2019s Color Wheel. An empirical study was conducted on the emotional effects of font types and sizes; this involved 60 users and was necessary because there are so few studies on fonts and emotions in the literature. With regard to font types, in statistical terms, it was found there were no significant differences, although Arial was more closely linked to positive emotions than Times New Roman in the discourse analysis. Small font sizes, 8pt, caused negative experiences and led to tiredness, while medium (12pt) and large (16pt) sizes were mainly related to pleasant and comforting experiences. The third study investigated tagged and felt emotions evoked by images which were collected through social tags that were clearly related to emotions. The aim of the study was to determine whether or not these images are reliable for the design and retrieval. Thus, an online survey was planned and carried out by a group of 410 volunteers who classified pictures from Flickr. The results suggested that there are some emotions tagged that were similar to observers emotions, while others are diffuse and need other criteria for their selection apart from social tags.

A study in emotional information retrieval", "abstract": "Some documents provoke emotions in people viewing them. Will it be possible to describe emotions consistently and use this information in retrieval systemsq We tested collective (statistically aggregated) emotion indexing using images as examples. Considering psychological results, basic emotions are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness. This study follows an approach developed by Lee and Neal (2007) for music emotion retrieval and applies scroll bars for tagging basic emotions and their intensities. A sample comprising 763 persons tagged emotions caused by images (retrieved from ) applying scroll bars and (linguistic) tags. Using SPSS, we performed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. For more than half of the images, the test persons have clear emotion favorites. There are prototypical images for given emotions. The document-specific consistency of tagging using a scroll bar is, for some images, very high. Most of the (most commonly used) linguistic tags are on the basic level (in the sense of Rosch's basic level theory). The distributions of the linguistic tags in our examples follow an inverse power-law. Hence, it seems possible to apply collective image emotion tagging to image information systems and to present a new search option for basic emotions.

This occurs because when using a library catalog for library searches, patrons often do not know the exact keywords to be included in a query that match the rigid subject terms (chosen by the Library of Congress) or terms in other fields of a desired library catalog record. These improperly formulated queries often translate into a high percentage of failed searches that retrieve irrelevant results or no results at all.

In solving this problem, we propose an enhanced library system, called EnLibS, which allows partial, similarity matching of (i) tags defined by ordinary users at a folksonomy site which describe the content of books and (ii) keywords in a library query to improve the searches on library catalogs. The proposed library system allows patrons to post a query Q with commonly-used words and ranks the retrieved results according to their degrees of resemblance with Q.
