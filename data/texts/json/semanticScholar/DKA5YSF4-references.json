In this early phase of their development, certain computer systems are being referred to as \u201csoftware agents\u201d or \u201cautonomous systems\u201d because they operate in a variety of ways that are seemingly independent of human control. However, because of the responsibility and liability issues, conceptualizing these systems as autonomous seems morally problematic and likely to be legally problematic. Whether software agents and autonomous systems are used to make financial decisions, control transportation, or perform military objectives, when something goes wrong, issues of accountability will indubitably arise. While it would seem that the law will ultimately have to handle these issues, law is currently being used only minimally or indirectly to address accountability for computer software failure. This nascent discussion of computer systems \u201cin the making\u201d seems a good focal point for considering innovative approaches to making law, governance, and ethics more helpful with regard to new technologies. For a start, it would seem that some anticipatory reasoning as to how accountability/liability issues are likely to be handled in law could have an influence on the development of the technology (even if the anticipatory thinking is ultimately wrong).

It also makes recommendations about what need to be measured to construct a complete picture of sustained ethical action in a profession.

The problem, however, is the question regarding how ethics can be incorporated into an earlier stage of technological development and it is this question that we argue has not yet been answered adequately. There is no consensus amongst scholars as to the kind of ethics that should be practiced, nor the individual selected to perform this ethical analysis. One school of thought holds that ethics should have pragmatic value in research and design and that it should be implemented by the (computer) engineers and/or (computer) scientists themselves, while another school of thought holds that ethics need not be so pragmatic. For the latter, the ethical reflection can aim at a variety of goals, and be carried out by an ethicist. None of the approaches resulting from these lines of thinking have been adopted on a wide-scale basis. To that end, the approach presented here is intended to bridge the gap between these schools of thought. It is our contention that ethics ought to be pragmatic and to provide utility for the design process and we maintain that adequate ethical reflection, and all that it entails, ought to be conducted by an ethicist. Thus, we propose a novel role for the ethicist\u2014the ethicist as designer\u2014who subscribes to a pragmatic view of ethics in order to bring ethics into the research and design of artifacts\u2014no matter the stage of development. In this paper we outline the series of steps that a pragmatic value analysis entails: uncovering relevant values, scrutinizing these values and, working towards the translation of values into technical content.

These processes included how an individual thinks through ethical problems (i.e., meta-cognitive reasoning strategies) and the emphasis placed on social dimensions of ethical problems (i.e., social\u2013behavioral responses). Method In 2005\u20132007, recruitment announcements were made, stating that a nationwide, online study was being conducted to examine the impact of RCR instruction on the ethical decision making of scientists. Recruitment yielded contacts with over 200 RCR faculty at 21 research universities and medical schools; 40 (20%) RCR instructors enrolled their courses in the current study. From those courses, 173 participants completed an ethical decision-making measure. Results A mixed pattern of effects emerged. The ethicality of decisions did not improve as a result of RCR instruction and even decreased for decisions pertaining to business aspects of research, such as contract bidding. Course participants improved on some meta-cognitive reasoning strategies, such as awareness of the situation and consideration of personal motivations, but declined for seeking help and considering others' perspectives. Participants also increased their endorsement of detrimental social\u2013behavioral responses, such as deception, retaliation, and avoidance of personal responsibility. Conclusions These findings indicated that RCR instruction may not be as effective as intended and, in fact, may even be harmful. Harmful effects might result if instruction leads students to overstress avoidance of ethical problems, be overconfident in their ability to handle ethical problems, or overemphasize their ethical nature. Future research must examine these and other possible obstacles to effective RCR instruction.", "venue": "Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 36, "citationCount": 90, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3366016", "name": "Alison L.

While all of these principles can be implemented in the current Internet's application layer, NDN enables them at the network layer, and thus encourages all applications to comport with them. We describe how these changes from TCP/IP will expand affordances for free speech, and produce positive outcomes for security, privacy and anonymity while raising new challenges regarding data retention and forgetting. We describe how these changes might alter current corporate and law enforcement content regulation mechanisms by changing the way data is identified, handled, and routed across the Web. We examine how even as NDN empowers edges with more decentralized communication options, by providing more context per packet than IP, it raises new challenges in ensuring neutrality across the public network.

Meta-ethics is concerned largely with philosophical questions about ethics rather than with substantive moral theories or issues themselves. This focus on meta-ethics, as well as the linguistic or analytic movement in philosophy generally, has vastly increased the philosophical sophistication and rigor of contemporary ethics. But on the debit side, moral and, in turn, political philosophers often have had very little to say directly relevant to the pressing moral issues of our time, and students as well as the general public have learned to look elsewhere for serious reflection on these issues. This is not to say that substantive moral and political philosophy has ceased to exist. Utilitarianism, the view that human actions and social institutions are morally justified to the extent that they tend to maximize the happiness of those they affect, has long engaged the interest and allegiance of many moral philosophers; it is a simple and systematic theory, capable of serving both as an individual ethic and as a social and political philosophy.

Substantial progress has been made toward resolving each of these issues. Ten motivationally distinct value types that were likely to be recognized within and across cultures and used to form value priorities were identified. Set of value types that was relatively comprehensive, encompassing virtually all the types of values to which individuals attribute at least moderate importance as criteria of evaluation was demonstrated. The evidence from 20 countries was assembled, showing that the meaning of the value types and most of the single values that constitute them was reasonably equivalent across most groups. Two basic dimensions that organize value systems into an integrated motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and compatibilities were discovered. By identifying universal aspects of value content and structure, the chapter has laid the foundations for investigating culture-specific aspects in the future.", "venue": "", "year": 1992, "referenceCount": 94, "citationCount": 11210, "influentialCitationCount": 1661, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2026106", "name": "S.

In this paper, we propose ways of maturing the VSD methodology to overcome these limitations and present three empirical case studies that illustrate a family of methods to effectively engage local expressions of values.
