In this essay I will discuss what makes computers different from other technology and how this difference makes a difference in ethical considerations. In particular, I want to characterize computer ethics and show why this emerging field is both intellectually interesting and enormously important. On my view, computer ethics is the analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology and the corresponding formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of such technology. I use the phrase \u201ccomputer technology\u201d because I take the subject matter of the field broadly to include computers and associated technology. For instance, I include concerns about software as well as hardware and concerns about networks connecting computers as well as computers themselves. A typical problem in computer ethics arises because there is a policy vacuum about how computer technology should be used. Computers provide us with new capabilities and these in turn give us new choices for action. Often, either no policies for conduct in these situations exist or existing policies seem inadequate. A central task of computer ethics is to determine what we should do in such cases, i.e., to formulate policies to guide our actions. Of course, some ethical situations confront us as individuals and some as a society. Computer ethics includes consideration of both personal and social policies for the ethical use of computer technology. Now it may seem that all that needs to be done is the mechanical application of an ethical theory to generate the appropriate policy. But this is usually not possible. A difficulty is that along with a policy vacuum there is often a conceptual vacuum. Although a problem in computer ethics may seem clear initially, a little reflection reveals a conceptual muddle. What is needed in such cases is an analysis which provides a coherent conceptual framework within which to formulate a policy for action. Indeed, much of the important work in computer ethics is devoted to proposing conceptual frameworks for understanding ethical problems involving computer technology. An example may help to clarify the kind of conceptual work that is required. Let\u2019s suppose we are trying to formulate a policy for protecting computer programs. Initially, the idea may seem clear enough. We are looking for a policy for protecting a kind of intellectual property.

What did it take to write Big Data? A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for The Economist, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book Delete had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted Big Data to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read. Q. Are you big datas cheerleaders? A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big datas likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it. Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise? A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing peoples everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere. Q. Is Big Data then primarily a story about economic efficiency? A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but thats only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal changefrom urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life. Q. So big data offers only upside? A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book the dark side of big data. However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by propensity -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the fetishization of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations. Q. What can we do about this dark side? A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big datas risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues. If we do not take action soon, it might be too late.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 7, "citationCount": 2069, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1412534293", "name": "Viktor Mayer-Schnberger"}, {"authorId": "50603623", "name": "K.

This contribution focuses specifically on responsibilities in processes of knowing, a topic which is discussed under the heading of epistemic responsibility in philosophy. I argue that two perspectives regarding epistemic responsibility should be distinguished: (1) the individualistic perspective, focusing on individuals as knowers within increasingly complex and dynamic socio-technical epistemic systems and (2) the governance perspective, focusing on the question how systems and environments should be designed so that individuals can act responsibly. Different fields of research have offered valuable insights for the development of a notion of epistemic responsibility in a hyperconnected era, most notably the fields of (social) epistemology, philosophy of computing as well as feminist theory of science and technology. From those insights, two major challenges can be deduced: (1) To acknowledge the socio-technical entanglement of knowers while at the same time striving to support responsibility assumption and attribution and (2) to be attentive to power asymmetries within entangled socio-technical environments.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 33, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "17736848", "name": "Judith Simon"}]}}, {"contexts": ["This is referred to as micro-level power and is understood as the concept of centrality (Bonacich, 1987)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "55b342a6e7b07a3f27a7715665aba2c24ac352ca", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087194317", "DOI": "10.1086/228631"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55b342a6e7b07a3f27a7715665aba2c24ac352ca", "title": "Power and Centrality: A Family of Measures", "abstract": "Although network centrality is generally assumed to produce power, recent research shows that this is not the case in exchange networks.

If an event did not happen, could it have happened? Since there is evil, and God could have made the world without evil, did God fail to pick the best course? Grappling with such simple--yet still intriguing--puzzles, Leibniz was able to present attractively his new theories of the real and the phenomenal, freewill and determinism, and the relation between minds and bodies. Theodicy was Leibniz's only book-length work to be published in his lifetime, and for many years the work by which he was known to the world. Fully at home with the latest scienctific advances, Leibniz ultimately rejected the new atomistic philosophies of Descartes, Gassendi, and Hobbes, and drew upon the old cosmology of Aristotelian scholasticism. There could be no conflict, he argued between faith and reason, freedom and necessity, natural and divine law. Ingeniously defending his postulate of pre-established harmony, Leibniz made important advances in the precise analysis of concepts.\"", "venue": "", "year": 1952, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 274, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "69331829", "name": "G.
