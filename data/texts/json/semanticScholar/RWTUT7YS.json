In this paper, we present results from empirical studies of two online communities-Facebook and craigslist Missed Connections-that highlight the ways in which this underlying infrastructure and the user practices on these sites are inherently intertwined. We make particular use of a framework first introduced by Agre that focuses on the influence of eight underlying features of computing practice: ontology, standards, instrumentation, authentication, interpretation, selection, bias, and performance. The results of this analysis indicate how representational systems do more than simply represent the physical world; they are deeply intertwined with the social and material practices of everyday life.", "venue": "CSCW", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 22, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3299367", "name": "J.
