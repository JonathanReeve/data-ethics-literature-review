Two attempts to insert ethical intelligence into technical design communities to influence the design of technologies in ethical- and value-conscious ways are described, revealing discouraging results. Learning from these failed attempts, the article identifies three key challenges of pragmatic engagement with technical design communities: (1) confronting competing values; (2) identifying the role of the values advocate; and (3) the justification of a value framework. Addressing these challenges must become a priority if one is to be successful in pragmatically engaging with real-world business and design contexts to bring moral and ethical intelligence to bear in the design of emerging information and communication technologies.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 55, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1403835066", "name": "No\u00ebmi Manders-Huits"}, {"authorId": "145416457", "name": "M.
