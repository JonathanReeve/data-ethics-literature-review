The adaptation of scientific books with a narrative structure is carried out with the aim of helping the process of grouping information that will be used into a designed motion graphic video, as well as to help in making motion graphic structures by writing the script. The methodology used in this paper is research by conducting a literature study from existing sources and references from books or journals, before entering the stage of analysing scientific books. The adaptation phase begins by analysing a scientific book entitled Positive Body Image using the Freytag's Pyramid narrative structure method. It is not only used to analyse and classify information but is also used as a reference in writing scripts based on the narrative structure of the Freytag Pyramid, which can determine the structure of the designed motion graphic.

It is configured as a space for interaction and collaboration that coordinates collective creativity as a generator of meaning. Because of this, nowadays the platform constitutes an enabling environment for subjectivation. Women and men participate by sharing or consuming videos, although the visibility and experiences are different for each gender. The aim of this study is to analyse the presence of women in the new spaces of participation, both from the perspective of producers and consumers of content. An analysis based on Web Scraping of the Instagram profiles of the 50 most successful Youtubers in Spain was carried out. The data obtained was analysed with the statistical software R. The results show a low representation of women among the channels with the highest number of views and subscribers. In addition, there is a lower presence of a female audience. Both roles, women as content creators and as consumers, are mostly associated with stereotypically feminine content such as beauty, drawmylife and fitness sports. The study shows that YouTube, the platform representing the new online participation spaces, reproduces the gender power structures of traditional media. An analytical approach to media education is needed to fight against sexist representations, stereotypes and under-representation of women in public spaces.

Moreover, we analyse potentially new factors for creating social media superstardom that may be special to the nature of social media. Our overall result is that the economics of superstars, like the role of talent, market concentration effects, MacDonald-style and Adler-style effects, remain applicable and relevant for social media stars. In line with this assessment, we find that several (allegedly) new star factors in social media, like user-generated content, prosumption, disappearance of gatekeepers and authenticity, turn out to be only partly applicable or just slightly different to traditional concepts. However, algorithm management and upload strategies represent novel success factors relevant for social media superstardom that are not captured by traditional superstar theories.", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 274, "citationCount": 18, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "122593539", "name": "Sophia Gaenssle"}, {"authorId": "66768036", "name": "Oliver Budzinski"}]}}, {"contexts": ["On YouTube, the concept of virality is that users share links to a video, which is embedded on the poster\u2019s channel page (Burgess & Green, 2009)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "d85ac0542fa3ed6ddf7755952af8f84454d21a2a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2989599110", "DOI": "10.1177/2056305119890051"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d85ac0542fa3ed6ddf7755952af8f84454d21a2a", "title": "Scratching a Niche: How Smaller Social Media Players Such as Dribbble Reflect the Viral Phenomenon", "abstract": "Researchers have been studying the viral flow of information since the late 1990s, but this work has mainly focused on big sites like Twitter and Facebook.

Interviews confirm that viral-like events do exist on Dribbble. Our informants suggest that what spreads on Dribbble are elements of design (e.g., color palettes, line styles, textures), and they identify a number of factors they believe drive these viral-like events, which are the same kinds of factors that drive virality on larger sites.

Our analysis of these platforms and reported user experiences shows that formal governance measures like Terms of Service and flagging mechanisms did not protect users from harassment, discrimination, and censorship. Key components of the platforms\u2019 architectures, including cross-platform connectivity, hashtag filtering, and algorithmic recommendation systems, reinforced these technocultures. This significantly limited queer women\u2019s ability to participate and be visible on these platforms, as they often self-censored to avoid harassment, reduced the scope of their activities, or left the platform altogether.

In the analysis, the actantial model of Greimas\u2019 theory of structural semiotics was applied.\n\n\nFindings\nTwo main types of videos were identified \u2013 sobriety and controlled use \u2013 where polydrug use has different meanings. In sobriety videos, polydrug use is presented as the heavy use of multiple substances. In the videos dealing with controlled use, polydrug use is taken as the combining of certain substances. Whereas the sobriety videos emphasized total abstinence from all substances due to their destructiveness, the videos about controlled use emphasized risk awareness when combining substances. Despite modern digital media and a new generation operating in this space, the messages of the risks of polydrug use mainly repeat those of familiar discourses.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper offers an analytical insight into the ways in which the risks of polydrug use are conceptualized in a YouTube context that is increasingly gaining a foothold among the youth. Greimas\u2019 actantial model offers a fruitful tool to find semiotic meanings that hide under the surface.
