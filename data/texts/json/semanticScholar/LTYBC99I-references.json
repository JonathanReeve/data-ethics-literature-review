As of 1987- 1988, women constituted slightly more than half of the U.S. population and 45% of employed workers in the U.S., but they made up only 30% of employed computer scientists. Moreover, they constituted only 10% of employed doctoral-level computer scientists. During the same time period, women made up 20% of physicians and, at the doctoral level, 35% of psychologists, 22% of life scientists, and 10% of mathematicians employed in the U.S. On the other hand, there are some disciplines in which women represent an even smaller proportion at the doctoral level: in 1987-88, 8% of physical scientists, and only 2.5% of engineers were women [21].1 The underrepresentation of women in computer science is alarming for at least two reasons. First, it raises the disturbing possibility that the field of computer science functions in ways that prevent or hinder women from becoming part of it. If this is so, those in the discipline need to evaluate their practices to ensure that fair and equal treatment is being provided to all potential and current computer scientists. Practices that exclude women are not only unethical, but they are likely to thwart the discipline's progress, as potential contributors to the field are discouraged from participation.\nThe second reason for concern about the underrepresentation of women in computer science relates to demographic trends in the U.S., which suggest a significant decrease in the number of white males entering college during the next decade. At the same time, the number of jobs requiring scientific or engineering training will continue to increase. Because white males have traditionally constituted the vast majority of trained scientists and engineers in this country, experts have predicted that a critical labor shortage is likely early in the next century [4, 25]. To confront this possibility, the federal government has begun to expend resources to study the problem further. A notable example is the establishment of a National Task Force on Women, Minorities, and the Handicapped in Science and Technology. Their final report, issued in December of 1989, lists a number of government and industrial programs aimed at preventing a labor shortage by increasing the number of women and minorities trained as scientists and engineers [5].\nIn light of these facts, the Committee on the Status of Women in Computer Science, a subcommittee of the ACM's Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights, was established with the goal of studying the causes of women's continued underrepresentation in the field, and developing proposed solutions to problems found. It is the committee's belief that the low number of women working as computer scientists is inextricably tied up with the particular difficulties that women face in becoming computer scientists.\nStudies show that women in computer science programs in U.S. universities terminate their training earlier than men do. Between 1983 and 1986 (the latest year for which we have such figures) the percentage of bachelor's degrees in computer science awarded to women was in the range of 36-37%, while the percentage of master's degrees was in the range of 28-30s. During the same time span, the percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women has only been in the range of 10-12%, and it has remained at that level, with the exception of a slight increase in 1989 [16, 21]. Moreover, the discrepancy between the numbers of men and women continues to increase when we look at the people who are training the future computer scientists: women currently hold only 6.5% of the faculty positions in the computer science and computer engineering departments in the 158 Ph.D.-granting institutions included in the 1988- 1989 Taulbee Survey (See Communications September 1990). In fact, a third of these departments have no female faculty members at all [16]. This pattern of decreasing representation is generally consistent with that of other scientific and engineering fields [4, 25]. It is often described as \u201cpipeline shrinkage\u201d: as women move along the academic pipeline, their percentages continue to shrink.\nThe focus of this report is pipeline shrinkage for women in computer science. We describe the situation for women at all stages of training in computer science, from the precollege level through graduate school. Because many of the problems discussed are related to the lack of role models for women who are in the process of becoming computer scientists, we also concern ourselves with the status of women faculty members. We not only describe the problems, but also make specific recommendations for change and encourage further study of those problems whose solutions are not yet well understood.\nOf course, our focus on computer science in the university by no means exhausts the set of issues that are relevant to an investigation of women in computer science. Most notably, we do not directly address issues that are of concern exclusively or primarily to women in industry. Although some of the problems we discuss are common to all women computer scientists, there are, without doubt, other problems that are unique to one group or the other. Nonetheless, the committee felt that an examination of the process of becoming a computer scientist provided a good starting point for a wider investigation of women in the field. Clearly, to increase the number of women in industrial computer science, one must first increase the number of women trained in the discipline. Thus, we need to consider why women stop their training earlier than men: too few women with bachelor's degrees in computer science translates into too few women in both industry and academia. Moreover, because of the documented positive effects of same-sex role models [12], it is also important to consider why women drop out in higher numbers than do men even later in their academic training: too few women with doctorate degrees results in too few women faculty members. This in turn means inadequate numbers of role models for younger women in the process of becoming computer scientists.", "venue": "CACM", "year": 1990, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 116, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49303714", "name": "A.

Design: Qualitative study using focus groups, naturalistic observation of consumers searching the world wide web in a usability laboratory, and in-depth interviews. Participants: A total of 21 users of the internet participated in three focus group sessions. 17 participants were given a series of health questions and observed in a usability laboratory setting while retrieving health information from the web; this was followed by in-depth interviews. Setting: Heidelberg, Germany. Results: Although their search technique was often suboptimal, internet users successfully found health information to answer questions in an average of 5 minutes 42 seconds (median 4 minutes 18 seconds) per question. Participants in focus groups said that when assessing the credibility of a website they primarily looked for the source, a professional design, a scientific or official touch, language, and ease of use. However, in the observational study, no participants checked any \u201cabout us\u201d sections of websites, disclaimers, or disclosure statements. In the post-search interviews, it emerged that very few participants had noticed and remembered which websites they had retrieved information from. Conclusions: Further observational studies are needed to design and evaluate educational and technological innovations for guiding consumers to high quality health information on the web.

Doing justice to moral problems.", "abstract": "Suppose I face a moral problem, how ought I go about figuring out what to do? The question is not simply how I should evaluate proposed courses of action, but how I go about devising such courses of action, a subject on which, as Stuart Hampshire observed in 1949 and again in 1989, ethics has had little to say.[1] Ethical judgments are important in devising responses to moral problems, of course. These judgments come in many forms, from \"What is being proposed is morally wrong\" to \"This safety factor (or margin) is sufficient for the circumstances in which this object or process will operate.\" Yet people confronted with ethical problems must do more than simply make judgments. They must figure out what to do. This is the reason for calling them \"agents.\" Scholars and popular writers alike often confine themselves to the judge's perspective, for example, when philosophers working in professional ethics take the making of moral judgments or criteria for praising and blaming to be the whole of their subject matter, or when the press, reporting on some accident or miscarriage of science or engineering, takes the main question to be \"Who is to blame?\" In these cases the restriction of perspective is fairly explicit. However, as I have discussed elsewhere, it is also implicit in the representation of moral problems as dilemmas to which the only solutions are those given with the problem itself, so that the only task is to judge which of the proposed solutions is the best (or least bad).[2] It is not enough to be able to evaluate well-defined actions, motives, etc., because actual moral problems are not multiple-choice problems. One must devise possible courses of action as well as evaluate them. Suppose my supervisor tells me to dispose of some regulated toxic substance by dumping it down the drain. In this case part of my problem is that I have been ordered to do something that is potentially injurious to human health and, furthermore, illegal. Assuming that my supervisor knows, as I do, that the substance is a regulated toxic substance (an assumption that I should--verify), then my supervisor's order is unethical and illegal. This is an example of a moral judgment that I make in describing the situation. In the case I have just described the question is what can and should I do. It is not enough to say that I should not dump the waste down the drain. My problem is not the simple choice of answering yes or no to the question of whether I should follow the order. I need to figure out what to do about the supervisor's order. Shall I ignore it? Refuse it? Report it to someone? To someone else in the company? To the Environmental Protection Agency? Should I do something else altogether? Is there any place I can go for advice about my options in a situation like this? What are the likely consequences of using those channels (if they exist)? Where could I find out those consequences? Also, what do I do with that toxic waste, at least for the present? These are questions with important implications for fairness to others, including people in my organization, and for the health and safety of the public, as well as for my relationship with my supervisor and for my own position within the company. Answering the question of what to do will depend on a variety of factors. Learning what factors to consider and how to assess them are components of responsible professional behavior. The importance of finding good ways of acting (and not merely the ability to come up with the right answer to a \"whether\" question) may be brought home by reflecting on when you or I last poured paint solvents, petroleum wastes, acetone (nail polish remover), motor oil, garden pesticides, or other household hazardous waste down the drain (or put spent batteries in the trash).

Imagine, for example, that a young Muslim man is interested in exploring the historical roots of jihad for a term paper. Imagine, too, that his library logs all digital reference interactions, and has a policy that if subpoenaed, such logs can be made available to law enforcement agencies. Under such conditions , this man might well decide to seek relevant information by other means, as he seeks to balance the value of access to information with other competing values such as privacy, consent, personal safety, security , and religious freedom. Despite the clear importance of values in human information behavior, the information behavior field does not yet have a comprehensive way of approaching this area. Value Sensitive Design offers one such approach. Value Sensitive Design (VSD) emerged in the 1990s as an approach to the design of information and computer systems that accounts for human values throughout the design process Two overarching goals motivate VSD: 1) to be proactive about human values in system design, and 2) to do so in a manner that is principled, comprehensive, and systematic. VSD particularly emphasizes values with moral import, including privacy, trust, human dignity, respect for person, physical and psychological well-being, informed consent, intellectual property, access, universal usability, freedom from bias, moral responsibility, and moral accountability. While emphasizing the moral perspective, VSD also accounts for usability (e.g., ease of use), conventions (e.g., standardization of technical protocols), and personal predilections (e.g., color preferences within a graphical interface).

As a secondary purpose, this looked at the issue of whether educational computer games affect girls' and boys' perceptions of the study of mathematics and the relevance of mathematics to their lives. \nSome theorists have stated that gender-neutral educational media do not have the same appeal to students as gender-oriented media. This study sought to answer the specific question of whether students preferred using gender-neutral or gender-oriented computer games related to the subject of math. \nA descriptive-correlational research design combined with a qualitative research data-collection approach was used. Data included pre-game-playing and post-game-playing interviews, performance data based on computer game scores, and the researcher's observations. The study was conducted in the spring of 2003 with the two fourth-grade classes at a Midwestern public elementary school. \nStudy participants were asked to play three specific computer games: a female-oriented game, a male-oriented game, and a gender-neutral game. The gender orientation of the three games had been determined by the researcher based on an in-depth study of the body of relevant literature on gender-related characteristics of video and computer games. \nThe findings showed that participants, both the girls and the boys, identified Mind Twister Math, the gender-neutral game as their favorite game. When participants were asked to name their second favorite game, their responses were along gender lines, i.e., the girls chose Phoenix Quest, the female-oriented game as their second favorite, while the boys chose NFL Math, the male-oriented game, as their second favorite. Findings indicated that boys scored higher on all three computer games; however, with repeated sessions of play, the girls' scores increased significantly and the girls' final scores were drawing close to the boys' final scores. \nThe study also found that both girls and boys believed the subject of math was relevant to their daily lives both before and after the game-playing. Game-playing significantly affected the girls' and boys' perceptions of liking or disliking the subject of mathematics. The study concludes that math-related educational computer games that are gender-neutral in orientation can appeal to both girls and boys and can positively affect their perceptions of the subject of mathematics.", "venue": "", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 14, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "69004938", "name": "Suzanne K.

It is also an exceptionally open process, with the current status of the development process visible to the customers, as well as the code and documentation. We are using YP in developing the software for UrbanSim, a sophisticated simulation system for modeling urban land use, transportation, and environmental impacts over periods of 20 or more years under alternate possible scenarios. Our purpose in developing UrbanSim is to support public deliberation and debate on such issues as building a new light rail system or freeway, or changing zoning or economic incentives, as well as on broader issues such as sustainable, livable cities, economic vitality, social equity, and environmental preservation. The domain of use is thus politically charged, with different stakeholders bringing strongly held values to the table. Our goal is to not favor particular stakeholder values in the simulation or its output, but rather to let different stakeholders evaluate the results in light of what is important to them. There are several implications of this for the development process. First, having credible, reliable code is important - and further, both the code itself and the development process that produced it should be open and inspectable, not a black box.

This reader challenges that assumption and its distinguished contributors demonstrate that technology is affected at a fundamental level by the social context in which it develops. General arguments are introduced about the relation of technology to society and different types of technology are examined: the technology of production; domestic and reproductive technology; and military technology. The book draws on authors from Karl Marx to Cynthia Cockburn to show that production technology is shaped by social relations in the workplace. It moves on to the technologies of the household and biological reproduction, which are topics that male-dominated social science has tended to ignore or trivialise - though these are actually of crucial significance where powerful shaping factors are at work, normally unnoticed. The final section asks what shapes the most frightening technology of all - the technology of weaponry, especially nuclear weapons. The editors argue that social scientists have devoted disproportionate attention to the effects of technology on society, and tended to ignore the more fundamental question of what shapes technology in the first place. They have drawn both on established work in the history and sociology of technology and on newer feminist perspectives to show just how important and fruitful it is to try to answer that deeper question. The first edition of this reader, published in 1985, had a considerable influence on thinking about the relationship between technology and society. This second edition has been thoroughly revised and expanded to take into account new research and the emergence of new theoretical perspectives.", "venue": "", "year": 1987, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 812, "influentialCitationCount": 18, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "123283352", "name": "D.

The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, \u201ccontextual integrity,\u201d as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of \u201cspheres of justice,\u201d developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 22, "citationCount": 1312, "influentialCitationCount": 105, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2994505", "name": "H.

The article shows that the failure to confront key analytic ambivalences in the practice of SSK has compromised its original strategic significance. In particular, the construal of SSK as an explanatory formula diminishes its potential for profoundly reconceptualizing epistemic issues. A consideration of critiques of technological determinism, and of some empirical studies, reveals similar analytic ambivalences in the social study of technology (SST). The injunction to consider \"technology as text\" is critically examined. It is concluded that a reflexive interpretation of this slogan is necessary to recover some of the epistemological significance lost in the constructivist move from SSK to SST.", "venue": "", "year": 1991, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 317, "influentialCitationCount": 17, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3277936", "name": "S.
