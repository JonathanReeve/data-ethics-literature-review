Using music as a test case, this article examines the use of algorithms and data mining techniques for the presentation and representation of culture, and how these tools reconfigure the process of cultural intermediation. Expanding Bourdieu\u2019s notion of cultural intermediaries to include technologies like algorithms, I argue that an emerging layer of companies \u2013 call them infomediaries \u2013 are increasingly responsible for shaping how audiences encounter and experience cultural content. Through a critical analysis of The Echo Nest, a music infomediary whose databases underpin many digital music services, I trace the shift from intermediation to infomediation and explore what is at stake at the intersection of data mining, taste making and audience manufacture. The new infomediary logics at work are computational forms of power that shape popular culture and highlight the social implications of curation by code.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 119, "influentialCitationCount": 16, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2118151700", "name": "J.
