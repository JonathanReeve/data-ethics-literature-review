Viewing the relationship between evidence and dominant policy solutions through the lens of complexity", "abstract": "Abstract Electric vehicles are a dominant policy solution in the EU. In policy documents, a transition to electric vehicles is justified through promises of a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and oil imports, as well as positive impacts on citizens (through reduced pollution) and the economy (through a boost in manufacturing and the generation of jobs). The evidence supporting such claims remains uncertain. Taking a stance that is grounded in complexity science, we introduce a hierarchical mapping of policy mechanisms, concerns and solutions \u2013 the elements making up policy narratives. Building on this mapping, we focus on questioning the solution-justification relationship for electric vehicles, by critically inspecting the material coherence between these justifications and the existing existing evidence. A targeted review shows how, for example, positive economic impacts largely depend on the location of battery and car manufacturing; or GHG emission reductions depend on promises of decarbonisation of the electricity sector, as well as on driving behaviours. Innovations are not just material objects, and such evidence does not necessarily weaken the dominant policy solution, nor the socio-technical imaginary it is grounded in. By questioning the material coherence of EV justification narratives in the EU, this case study points to a discussion about the effects of dominant policy narratives on the generation of science, warning against policy-based evidence in the co-creation of socio-technical imaginaries.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 94, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "119835868", "name": "L.

A conceptual framework is introduced to support comparison between cities in terms of the processes by which open space is (re-)distributed between car and bicycle circulatory and regulatory space. This framework distinguishes between regulatory allocation mechanisms and the appropriation practices of actors. Application to cases in Amsterdam, Brussels and Birmingham reveal unique relationships created by the zero-sum nature of urban open space between the dominant automobility mode and subordinate cycling mode. These relationships open up a new approach to forms of lock-in that work in favour of particular mobility modes within the relatively obdurate urban built environment.

As a key to understanding and changing practice I argue that storytelling plays a crucial role on different scales.

This article studies pickup trucks and masculinities in relation to home and work in the industrial construction sector in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. There, like in much of North America, trucks have become the most commonly purchased new vehicles over the last decade. Their widespread popular appeal contrasts with their historical development for manual labour gendered as masculine, such as farming and fishing, in rural places and environments conducive to such labour. Drawing on interviews with construction industry actors and workers, the article shows how new, expensive trucks have come to reflect the hegemonic masculinity at male-dominated industrial construction projects, while also showing how the meanings and uses of trucks are complex and contested. Trucks are understood to be functional for work and driving, but they are also status symbols, often used only sparingly for commuting, masculinized domestic work and leisure activities. The article unpacks the new and expanding popularity of the truck and its positioning in practice in relation to masculinities, work, and to the landscape in a place-based gender regime.

The inquiry occurred in four phases and over two action cycles. In Phase I, a semi-structured questionnaire administered to eighty automotive dealers and salespeople at four client organizations suggested that the firm\u2019s ethics consulting practice was not adaptive to varied situational contexts and unpredictable changes in the regulatory domain. This resulted in abysmal ethical compliance rates, regulatory fines, and general client dissatisfaction. A thematic analysis of open-ended responses provided by respondents yielded five broad themes - knowledge gaps, organizational structure, interpersonal relationships, internal collaboration, and service design. The objective of this interventive research is to create an agile ethics advisory practice through the generation of actionable knowledge that addresses the aforementioned thematic angles. By leveraging the emancipatory capacity of social constructivism in Phase II, an internal focus group comprising of fifteen stakeholders, utilized Soft System Methodology, an Action Research approach to elucidate the organizational problem. The structured inquiry culminated in the first cycle of remedial actions with implications for the firm\u2019s personnel, internal politics, corporate structure, and go-to-market strategy. In Phase III, organizational outcomes were validated internally and externally through the reflexive analysis of data collected with semi-structured questionnaires and focus group interviews in the post-intervention era. Open-ended responses were explored using thematic analysis. Due to the small size of the firm, a total population sampling strategy was adopted within the organization encompassing all twenty internal stakeholders. Critical case data sampling was carried out at a representative client site in a test case ethical compliance consulting project that involved twenty-eight external stakeholders. In the post-intervention survey, 87% of the external respondents agreed that Dealers R\u2019Us\u2019 ethics and ethical compliance program became responsive to varied and evolving ethical compliance needs in Ontario\u2019s automotive retail industry. In contrast, only 16% of survey respondents agreed with the same statement in the pre-intervention phase. This outcome resulted from a reduction in consultant knowledge gaps; a transition from a hierarchical functional organizational structure to a matrix structure comprised of interdisciplinary teams; a deliberate focus on improving interpersonal relationships between consultants; the equalization of power within the firm and a service redesign effort that entailed the field colocation of interdisciplinary teams. In Phase IV, this outcome informed a second action cycle geared towards an entrenchment of the transformative research agenda. Based on agreements in management literature, I conceptualized agility using ideas from Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory including self-organization and spontaneous emergence. Other applied theories include Social Identity Theory and Contingency Theory. The results obtained challenge the traditional approach to ethics consulting. They inspired the development and recommendation of a Conceptual Framework for Agile Ethics Consulting to the firm. This original contribution to ethics advisory practice and consulting literature codifies relevant agility drivers, enablers, capabilities and practices. Foundational recommendations border on data proximity, selective contingency, the establishment of active feedback loops, incremental solution execution; the attainment of a common internal identity and the incentivization of strong interpersonal bonds within the firm. For automotive dealerships, this inquiry provides accessibility to custom-tailored ethical compliance programs, higher compliance rates and the mitigation of risks and liabilities resulting from non-compliance. In a reflective manner, I draw conclusions on the post-intervention status of the ethics practice under review based on CAS theory metrics. In addition to taking stock of my scholar-practitioner experience, I also discuss transitions in my leadership philosophy. The small size of Dealers R\u2019Us translates into a relatively small sample size. This is a research limitation that must be considered when interpreting the outcomes of this research. The collection of data from external sources at different intervals and the utilization of multiple dialectics afforded by Soft System Methodology helped to seek out disconfirming evidence and mitigate this limitation.

Consequently, this study accounts for consumption not exclusively through human entities but through practices as a relational compilation of different (non-) human entities. In centring practices as unit of analysis instead of the consumer, this study joins an existing family of what might be termed materially oriented \u2013flat\u2013 ontologies in consumer research. This study further stresses that committing to practices as ontological units of analysis is not enough on its own to account for phenomena because practices themselves are merely the fabric through which social phenomena transpire (Schatzki, 2012, 2016). Therefore, the practice approach of this study is innovatively paired with Gramsci\u2019s (1971) and Laclau and Mouffe\u2019s (2001) political theories of hegemony and social antagonism to better account for the understudied relations between, or politics of, (un-)sustainable practices (Hargreaves, 2011, Hargreaves et al., 2013, Gram-Hanssen, 2011). The empirical part of this study looks at urban cycling in Las Palmas, Spain, where car driving is the unsustainable dominant form of transport. According to a practice ontology, the research question was reframed from \u2018why don\u2019t people choose to cycle\u2019? to \u2018why is the sustainable practice of urban cycling marginalised?\u2019 Guided by two definitions of practices from social theory (Schatzki, 1996, Shove et al., 2012), and a research design from organizational studies (Nicolini, 2009a), fieldwork and data analysis were of a hybrid inductive nature in exploring the detailed and relational character of the practice elements \u2018meanings, competence and materials\u2019. Methods included mobile visual ethnography, historical analysis, participant observation, unstructured (group) interviews, netnography and documentary data analysis. Findings suggest that to understand why urban cycling as a sustainable practice is marginalised we need to first examine the relationship between practice elements inside practices and second the politics of relations between related practices. Consequently, the evolution of urban cycling is hindered by both, internal and external conflicts between practices. Several practices compete with urban cycling for material, skilful, and symbolic resources, such as stealing, policing, schooling and lobbying. These seem to bundle together supporting the dominant unsustainable practice of car driving, the most obvious resource-rival to urban cycling. Building on concepts taken from Gramsci and Laclau and Mouffe, this study introduces the term \u2018synergist practices\u2019 to show that the existence of a sustainable (antagonist) practice is conditioned by several practices (synergists) instead by a mere dualist relationship with unsustainable practices (agonist). The introduction of a practice ontology for the study of sustainable consumption yields three essential contributions to Consumer Culture Theory (CCT), Transformative Consumer Research (TCR) and Macromarketing. Firstly, this study reveals how hierarchies and partnerships among practices iv have the ability to constrain or enable sustainable consumption. This study thereby extends the notion of \u2018flattening\u2019 out consumption studies as it assesses how the equal split of agency among practice-elements, i.e. material, competence and meanings does not necessarily indicate the absence of hierarchies and domination among practices as entities. Secondly, understanding (un-)sustainable consumption as the outcome of complex relationships between different competing practices instead of agentic consumer choice, deconstructs empirically the underlying neo-liberalistic assumptions of CCT, Macromarketing and TCR and accompanying beliefs about behaviour change. Sustainable consumption, the study suggests, depends on the (im-)possibilities of sustainable practices and their constitutive resources not on the will of the individual. This offers an alternative view on the \u2018green behaviour gap\u2019 (Moraes et al., 2011, Claudy and Peterson, 2014) in that consumers, although deliberately wanting one thing, are not always able to follow through with their \u2018beliefs\u2019 Thirdly, transformational research to achieve well-being might best target the well-being of practices primarily to achieve effective social change for humankind.

What has structured such imaginary? And what levers can steer its evolution towards a Post-Car World? These very three questions form the foundational motivations of this thesis. First, through a historical overview, I explore and analyze a selected corpus of verbal and visual discourses that have contributed to how we think of car, how we think of a transition from it, and interrelatedly how it is placed in our cities. An oppositional relation against walking seems to majorly explain the changing position of car. The comfort, speed, and privacy of car have been put against the effort, slowness and sociability of walking. By tracing the shifting values of these qualities, I detect and depict the evolution of car-pedestrian imaginaries. Second, two series of encounters with urban actors\u00e2\u0080\u0093urban experts and inhabitants\u00e2\u0080\u0093 were conducted. (1) Interviewing eight urban experts (active practitioners in the field of urbanism), I quest for their assessment of the current \u00e2\u0080\u009cweak signs\u00e2\u0080\u009d of transition from car in urban space, their vision for its future in various urban forms, as well as the perks and perils of emerging technologies, as mobility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cwild cards\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The transversal analysis of the interviews, using the theory-generating methodology (Bogner and Menz 2009), results in a set of extracted themes, common threads, visionary strategies, as well as contextualized tools. (2) In a Focus Group composed of eight inhabitants of the territory of Arc Lemanique Lausanne-Geneva area, the participants discussed various post-car scenarios that we had developed over the course of two Teaching Units held at EPFL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school of Architecture. The analysis of the transcribed discussions revealed some of the salient motivations and impediments towards a post-car world. Cross-referencing the participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lifestyles with their expressed views indicates a dissociation of inhabitants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 daily practice of car mobility from their ideal of a mobile lifestyle. Considering the role of urban projects as a mediator, I confront the experts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 representations, ideas and references with the discourses of the inhabitants. As city is increasingly to be approached as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwork without author\u00e2\u0080\u009d, urban project (scenarios, visions, plans) becomes a dispositif of exchange and discussion, animating a process in which imaginations, assumptions, desires, and insights are exchanged, becoming the telltale of imaginaries rather than prescription for cities and territories. Third, I propose three conceptual axes along which the questions of post-car mobility, are reformulated. Such reformulation, I discuss, not only can act upon the imaginaries, but also have implications for urban projects. The notions of Effort, Agility, and Vehicular Units are presented and shown that together can create a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoordinate system\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which mobility discourses go beyond the previously mentioned polarities of car-pedestrian, towards values that set in-between, in order to reinvent the \u00e2\u0080\u009cauto\u00e2\u0080\u009d mobility for a more sustainable future. I present each axis in extent, situate them within the context of their emergence, and argue for their relevance and potentials. Finally, I argue for broadening the development of these three notions into cogent and cohesive analytical forces to constitute major axes of transformation capable of engendering new sets of understandings and discourses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 new imaginaries.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 198, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "32048399", "name": "Farzaneh Bahrami"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": ["A significant portion of mobilities literature focuses on automobilities (Bull,\n2004; Conley & McLaren, 2009; Edensor, 2011; Featherstone, 2004; Laurier, 2011; Merriman, 2011; Sheller, 2004; Sheller & Urry, 2006; Urry, 2004)."], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "100ae1ddbe63903f5031ad4ae16c2cbb5ba7305f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2341261536"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/100ae1ddbe63903f5031ad4ae16c2cbb5ba7305f", "title": "A tank full of wishful thinking: Crystallizing the rhythms of the road", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 82, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "116533656", "name": "Leanna K.

The multiple dimensions of contemporary mobilities have been investigated by scholars from many different disciplines and it has been shown to be an ambivalent and reflexive phenomenon (Kesselring 2008; Freudendal-Pedersen 2014). Mobilities have brought about positive economic and social effects, such as wealth, international cultures of collaboration and exchange. But at the same time, issues such as increasing inequalities, climate change, urban sprawl and highly mobile energy-consuming lifestyles have put questions of sustainability centre stage. Historically, mobility has contained the idea and promise of frictionless movement, freedom and speed (Leed 1991; Urry 2007; Rosa and Scheuerman 2009; Jensen and Freudendal-Pedersen 2012), as that which would lead to better lives. Instead, visions of \u201cseamless mobility\u201d and a \u201czero-friction society\u201d (Hajer 1999) intensify risks of congestion, noise, urban degradation and environmental disasters (Urry 2011; Adey et al. 2013). The spatial and technological extension and speeding up of mobility systems has also led to intensified mobile forms of working, living and tourism (Hannam 2006; Kesselring 2006; Urry 2007; Beaverstock et al. 2009; FreudendalPedersen 2009). On the one hand, this has opened up hitherto unforeseen spaces of opportunity for new mobilities regimes for economies, transnational cultures, forms of intimacy and love, communication, communities and social networks (Mai and King 2009). New \u201ccultures of immediacy\u201d (Tomlinson 2004), dealing with distance and connectivity are emerging. But on the other hand, the possibilities of facilitating interaction from almost every place in the world have propelled a sort of \u201cbanal cosmopolitanization\u201d (Beck 2008) that has quietly changed the social routines and the spaces for lived everyday life (see Freudendal-Pedersen this issue). For example, the boom of peer-to-peer online platforms such as HomeExchange, CouchSurfing and Airbnb have arguably led to alternative models of hospitality (Russo and Dominquez 2016) which have in turn transformed entire urban neighbourhoods in major cities such as London, Barcelona, Paris and New York. The large number of new social opportunities and choices involve various complex mobilities to make them work and then often lead into further mobilities to secure their continuation \u2013 second and third-order mobilities. Nevertheless, people and materials have to be put in place and ordered so that occurrences can be planned for and made happen. This involves proactive planning which is shaped by the memories and disturbances of past events, management and organization in the present; and also involves projections into the future. In short, various mobilities inform systems, infrastructures and technologies which enable other mobilities which lead on to further systems, infrastructures and technologies in an on-going process of formation, critique, development and dissension (see Birtchnell this issue). Mobilities and the acquisition of them have become a defining feature of contemporary life, bound up with our pursuit of new identities (Kesselring 2008; Freudendal-Pedersen 2009; Elliott and Urry 2010; Salazar 2010; Kellerman 2012; Cohen, Duncan, and Thulemark 2013; Milbourne and Kitchen 2014; Taipale 2014).", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 112, "citationCount": 24, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1403235803", "name": "Malene Freudendal-Pedersen"}, {"authorId": "37805502", "name": "K.

The idea of planning urban development to meet human needs (a city for people) underlies many conceptions of urban development, especially those the basic goal of which is to limit suburbanisation unfavourable from a general social point of view and to rationalise the mobility of city residents. It has long been known that their mobility reflects the spatial structure of a city, and that their ever more intensive movement is not favourable from the ecological, social and economic points of view. In this situation it is necessary to shape the spatial-functional structure of the city in a way that will, first, restrict this mobility and, secondly, that will change the ways and means by which residents move. However, in order to make changes in the existing spatial structures in a rational way, it is necessary to know the mobility of city dwellers, its causes, directions, distances covered, and duration.

In Ireland, strategies for the mitigation of the effects of road traffic accidents appear in policy documents such as the Road Safety Strategy which is then disseminated via various media outlets. Such an approach highlights the centrality of mediation in the social acceptance of policy initiatives, relying on an assumption of media-centricity \u2013 that the mainstream media are central to social formation. This thesis problematizes this assumption. Drawing together the disparate elements of a dispositif of road safety in the under-researched Irish setting, this study explores the complex range of actors implicated in the mediation of policy. It examines the mediated policy context of the worst road accident in Irish history, as well as the introduction of a network of speed cameras, to explore how policy initiatives output in print media reports, as well as online discussion. Through analysis of car-commuters\u2019 focus group interactions, it also examines the ways in which mediated policy understandings are immanent and circulate in how car-commuters talk about their commuting practices. \nThe study highlights how mediated policy actions attempt to curb the unfettered expression of car-based freedoms through the construction of individual responsibility as the ultimate expression of road safety. However, commuters\u2019 freedoms are also shaped and constrained by responsibilities in terms of work, study, and family, as well as by the types of social action automobility makes conceivable, facilitates, and disrupts. In addition, the research shows that while rational choices and rationality are a dominant framework within policy contexts, mediation about road safety is actually enmeshed in multiple rationalities that surface as circumstances require. Exploration of driving practices reveals how commuters are nodes in their own networks of rationalities around automobility that adhere and disjoin to varying degrees with the concerns of media representation. The study also highlights the mainstream media consensus constructed around speed cameras, even though forms of resistance to this consensus manifest, especially online. Commuters\u2019 car-based activities can often also be resistant to discourses of road safety. Yet commuters fight to defend the space and time spent on forms of work performed in the car that reinforce the exigencies of neoliberalism.

Specific value of the dispositif concept consists in analysing multifaceted, but decentral power relations effecting inequalities in relation to mobilities at different scales, shown by way of existing studies of automobility. Thereby, the co-constitution of social order, space and hegemonic mobilities regimes moves to the fore. Yet, what is missing in this Foucauldian genealogy of mobility dispositifs is a broader conceptualisation of stabilising material conditions. Accordingly, I use elements of regulation theory as a complementary and framing social theory to understand the dispositifs of mobility as embedded in and stabilised through (but not as a simple function of) specific modes of regulation and regimes of accumulation.

It is regularly associated with global physical, social and ecological harms such as climate change and epidemics of lifestyle diseases, including obesity. Attempts to address these problems generally include provision for day-to-day physical mobility based on alternatives to the private car. Labelled alternative transport, these modes include public transport, walking and cycling. Yet the private car continues as the preferred way to travel in many cities. A deeper understanding of this preference can reveal under explored sites of resistance to alternative transport modes. This study uses qualitative methods to record very personal barriers to the uptake of alternative transport. Its focus is on the use of the car for the journey to work in suburban Sydney Australia's largest city. Applying a novel approach to participant selection, the study explores the daily practices and perceptions of those who continue to drive, despite having access to viable alternative transport. The study finds that resistance to alternative transport is more complex than findings to date suggests. Mobility practices stem from the active integration of skills, images and materials that potentially have little to do with transport. Instead, attachments to the private car, and resistance to alternative mobility, are products of other practices, such as parenting and working. The study reveals the way the private car is deeply engrained in the way people make sense of, and navigate, not only their streets but their place in the world. The complexity of the relationship between mobility practices and ways of being in the modern world can be represented through the concept of ontological security. Car-based autonomous mobility plays a key role in experiences of autonomy, predictability and acceptance all of which act to sustain a sense of coherency to modern life. Transition away from car use disturbs this sense of coherency and is essentially ontologically threatening. This way of thinking about resistance to alternative transport exposes a number of sticking points for its uptake junctures at which transition away from private car use will only occur in the face of unprecedented disruption to existing ways of 'being' in modern life. The research exposes a series of inconsistencies between the expectations of those planning for, and those anticipated to one day use, alternative transport.

For this reason programs that encourage active travel to school are often implemented by local authorities or schools. Many of these programs focus on the child. Cycle training or motivation programs aimed at a mode shift towards active travel are relatively easy to set up and can lead to quick results. Yet, a child centred review of the road infrastructure is necessary to sustain these modal shifts, as the road safety concerns of children and parents remain a major barrier to children\u2019s independent travel to school. The needs of youth and children are often neglected in road and traffic design. This fact can be traced to a number of factors. The number of children using an active travel mode to school can be very low to start with, while the road network that the children commute on can be extensive. Only little data is available on children\u2019s independent commuting patterns or their use of road infrastructure. These factors can lead to ad hoc decision making or to inactivity in implementing necessary road works. If only a fraction of a child\u2019s route to school is perceived to be unsafe, if has a great potential to prevent children from walking or cycling to school. Children\u2019s perception of dangerous road infrastructure is a major barrier to children\u2019s independent travel to school. This study asked children to trace the routes that they take to and from school on a provided paper map. The children were than encouraged to mark areas and places on the map of where they felt or unsafe in traffic, using a set of predefined symbols. The resulting routes and symbols have been digitalised and analysed using the Geographic Information System ArcView. Of the 172 surveys distributed to 6 th year students of St. Fiachras Primary School in Beaumont Dublin a 36 % response rate was recorded. From the resulting 62 routes, 22 are categorized as walking routes, 18 were cycling routes and 16 routes are those of car passengers. Defined differences in the distribution of positive and negative markers along these routes were recorded, whereby the location of negative markers pinpointed a distinct problem area in the road network. Surprisingly, on a site visit this area was served quite well with pedestrian / cycling infrastructure. The results of this study indicate that children\u2019s maps are a valuable analytical tool that can help road engineers to pinpoint problem areas in a road network in relation to specific road users. The methodology employed is cost effective and a fast method to survey small sample groups which can be used to analyse relatively large areas of road network and could be applied on a national scale.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 203, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1400376968", "name": "Frank Bondzio"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["Automobility, in particular, has been studied by historians as central to modernization projects of nation states [6][7], while sociologists and anthropologists have focused on understanding how our daily lives are structured and shaped by our dependence on cars[3][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]."], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "d3711fa782f02e453addade45e1dcf1ea554f417", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1965147478", "DBLP": "conf/automotiveUI/ZafirogluHP12", "DOI": "10.1145/2390256.2390279"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3711fa782f02e453addade45e1dcf1ea554f417", "title": "Navigation to multiple local transportation futures: cross-interrogating remembered and recorded drives", "abstract": "This paper describes findings from a three country, twenty-four participant study consisting of two in-home and in-car ethnographic interviews, separated by a month during which participants created videos, and their cars were GPS tracked and their Android smartphone data collected during and surrounding their driving times.

The focus for public health interventions is the bodies of children. Recent interpretive research into how pre-teenaged children talk about watching television suggests that these children may be using the \u2018feel\u2019 of being sedentary to resist the \u2018feel\u2019 of being busy, while engaging with electronic media and communication, precisely because e-media do the work of collapsing time and distance to create the experience of instant connection and consumption from inside the home. The generalised view that television \u2018stops you from doing anything\u2019 is expressed but with some ambivalence by both children and parents in our study. While the children discuss needs for space and rest, they may also be conveying the ways they address particular mental health needs in longer, busier and more stressful days, often with two parents working. They may be arguing for the feel of being stopped as society speeds up around them. Indeed, societies, sectors and publics are becoming more mobile, but children are charged with being more immobile and forgetting how to play actively and spontaneously. It could be feasible that children may enact a strategic, embodied resistance to living faster lives. This article argues that children's uses of inside spaces and e-media to \u2018still\u2019 time and \u2018stop\u2019 themselves are as important to sociological studies of how children experience mobilities as they are to sociotechnical studies of the digital generation.

Methods: The key response variable, self-reported street racing in past year, was examined in relation to grade level, rural/urban, school marks, cannabis use, drinking and driving, cannabis use and driving, and property, physical, drugs, and weapons delinquencies. All survey estimates were weighted, and variance and statistical tests were corrected for the complex sampling design. Results: Of the 3053 9th- to 12th-graders (66% response rate), 5.6 percent of high-schoolers (an estimated 42,000 in the province) and (20.4% of grade 11 and 12 students with an advanced-level or full license) reported driving a car, truck, or sport utility vehicle (SUV) in a street race in the 12 months before the survey. Logistic regression analysis of the advanced-level or fully licensed students in grades 11 and 12 found that males compared to females and students in grade 11 compared to students in grade 12 had significantly higher adjusted odds of street racing. Supportive of problem behavior theory, students who reported property and drug delinquencies compared to students not engaging in these delinquencies also had significantly higher adjusted odds of street racing. Conclusions: This first population-based study in North America suggested that the prevalence of street racing at 1 in 5 of advanced or fully licensed high-schoolers in grades 11 and 12 poses significant public health concerns, especially related to the potential for unintentional injury.", "venue": "Traffic injury prevention", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 13, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3445369", "name": "E.

Leonard Cohen Montreal 1964 MOST CANADIANS DEPEND ON A CAR, TRUCK, OR BUS for everyday travel and worry about congestion and the price of gas. The recent bailout of the auto sector and stimulus spending on roads, bridges, and highways reveal the commitment of Canadian governments to expanding traffic through motor vehicle use. As a shared way of flowing and idling in the world, however, traffic, in spite of mass participation and immense ecological import, remains a relatively elusive idea, and one too frequently dominated by a functionalist engineering approach. As a technoscientific attempt to eliminate congestion, this approach overlooks social understandings of traffic, its politics, and its cultural significance. I aim to extend an alternative understanding of \"traffic\" as irreducible to either congestion or itinerancy but marked instead by multiple relations of stasis and flow among human and nonhuman actors. To this end I draw on two different literatures, mobility studies and narrative approaches to urban planning, to explore how people imagine and practise traffic in a spatial culture of automobility. This narrative approach to urban planning highlights the multiplicity of traffic and the agency of material infrastructure (see Latour). By foregrounding the different voices of streets, I aim to defamiliarize the habitual voice of automobility. In contrast to modernization cum motorization narratives which follow a teleological plot line, the stories that streets tell from different temporal and spatial perspectives have the potential to disrupt a natural, apolitical culture of car-dependence. The mobilities literature that I will rely on argues that buildings, roads, and other kinds of places gain meaning through the ways in which they carry or constrict the flows of subjects, ideas, and objects. It views streets as sociotechnical ensembles of tarmac, electricity, hydrocarbons, values, juridical systems, and habitus. Built for particular bodies and machines, streets evoke the discursive and political construction of traffic alongside hard infrastructure. After situating traffic within mobilities and narrative approaches to planning, I follow the stories of five prominent streets in Canada's capital city. Ottawa represents a strategic case study of mobility and planning. Like Canberra, Brasilia, and New Delhi, Ottawa is a living product of muscular, modernist planning of the last century which equated national progress with mass automobility. To a greater degree than other conurbations in Canada, traffic in the National Capital Region reflects a totalizing vision of the good city in which the car is tied to modernity, national identity, and power. By engaging what some have called a relational \"politics of mobility\" (Cresswell, \"Politics\"; Simpson; Henderson), I argue that Ottawa's streets articulate a deeply contested process by which automobility has become systematically invested with forms of material and immaterial power denied to other forms of traffic. To build my case I draw on media discourse, photographs, planning documents, developmentese, and field observations. Through these materials I show that, along with the daily lives of street users, cars, and their manifold interactions, a critical if frequently forgotten world of traffic resides in the stories of streets themselves. Assembling a Politics of Automobility Over the last decade, research on the movement of people, goods, and ideas has enjoyed increasing attention. A growing interdisciplinary literature on \"mobilities\" explores how movement mediates social life and the creation of meaningful spaces in which people live together. The \"mobilities paradigm,\" as some refer to it, includes \"studies of corporeal movement, transportation and communications infrastructures, capitalist spatial restructuring, migration and immigration, citizenship and transnationalism, and tourism and travel\" (Hannam et al. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 22, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145836345", "name": "Nick Scott"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "e2d256c9e04f86a36bd1f4bf0753172252da14d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2188984502", "DOI": "10.12759/HSR.35.2010.4.102-121"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2d256c9e04f86a36bd1f4bf0753172252da14d4", "title": "Human Security and the Challenge of Automobile and Road Traffic Safety: A Cultural Historical Perspective", "abstract": "Die UN-Agenda zur menschlichen Sicherheit und die Herausforde rungen der Verkehrssicherheit aus kulturhistorischer Perspektive?. The worldwide enhancement of road traffic safety is one aspect of the UN agenda on \"human security\". The article examines the history of road traffic safety and the development of automobile safety technologies since the mid twentieth century with a strong focus on West Germany. From a historical perspective there are two reasons why the UN agenda includes the enhancement of road traffic safety. Firstly the development of road traffic safety is a \"success story\" in industrialized countries even though there are still high death rates globally. Secondly, the enhancement of road safety is linked to advanced civil societies with all their stakeholders, and strengthening civil society is a key concern of the UN worldwide. Beyond that, automobility is a symbol of modernity. Discourses about automo bile safety inform us about the conceptions and regulation of individual free dom and security in different societies. Moreover, new safety technologies such as the safety belt modify the interactions between human beings and ma chines and thus the idea of freedom, autonomy and responsibility. With the rise of the concept of human security, terms such as national security, internal and domestic security, social and economic security were fundamen tally expanded. This expansion of security as an important political term and concept integrates new societal values into the political discourse about secu rity.1 The human security agenda focuses on the global as well as the regional and integrates the protection of individuals, groups, and people. The UN pro gram strengthens individual rights, while the rights of groups, ethnicities or nations and in this respect the sovereignty of states have ostensibly taken a back seat.
