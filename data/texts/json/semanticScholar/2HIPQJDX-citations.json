Since then, its existence has been regularly reported on and solutions to close it have been proposed. However, after thirty years this gap resists all efforts for closure. In this study we assert that the gap between industry and academia exists for several reasons that are related and intertwined. To take a broader look at the problem from the perspective of all related entities, we (i) provide a detailed overview of the profession and identify the entities, (ii) extract the causes that stem from these entities and discuss what each entity should do, (iii) report and analyze the results of a questionnaire that has been conducted with students and recent graduates, (iv) emphasize the highlights of the interviews conducted with students, recent graduates and academics, (v) and compile a list of skills that are sought by the industry by analyzing the software engineering job advertisements. We further contribute to finding solutions by considering all entities involved, which provides an opportunity to access all of them, so that each can find out what they can do to acknowledge and narrow the gap. Our study concludes that the gap requires constant attention and hard work for all of the entities involved, and therefore all should be on the lookout for new technologies, learn to embrace the changes and adapt to them, so that the gap is kept at a minimum.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 60, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2476849", "name": "Damla Oguz"}, {"authorId": "51054295", "name": "Kaya Oguz"}]}}, {"contexts": ["Although abilities like math and analytical thinking are crucial to succeed in STEM degrees, they can be improved by adopting a growth mindset strategy in learning [14]."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "39869ff801caeb89f22d379c9ec83aa78a52ff7e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2947017285", "DOI": "10.18260/1-2--30730"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39869ff801caeb89f22d379c9ec83aa78a52ff7e", "title": "Investigation of Sense of Belonging to Engineering in Undergraduate Introductory Classes", "abstract": "This work-in-progress paper investigates students\u2019 sense of belonging in introductory classes in engineering and engineering physics. The research project involves students at three educational institutions with similar geographic location but with student bodies of differing demographics and character: a regional university; a community college; and a technical college. Studies have pointed to the effect of the lack of belonging among the classrooms, majors, and the institution in general on students\u2019 retention rates and performance in future engineering classes. Sense of belonging has been identified as particularly important to the retention of underrepresented minorities (URM) and women. In a multi-year study published in the 2012 ASEE conference [1] researchers at five institutions conducted an extensive research study of belonging among STEM students in four categories; belonging to the classroom, belonging to the major, belonging to the institution as a resource; and belonging to the institution as a community. Results show a statistically significant difference in belongingness among those students in those four categories at the five institutions based on students\u2019 classification. However, results suggested that hypothesizing a monotonic increase in the sense of belonging by year in school cannot be supported by the research findings and educators have to ultimately understand what impacts the sense of belonging and how to improve it over time during college years. At each of the three educational institutions where this current study is performed, the percentage of students who are identified as URMs is about one-fourth of the overall engineering student population. As more initiatives have been emerging in these institutions to help increase diversity and inclusion, the researchers were motivated to conduct this study to improve the belonging of engineering pre-major students in STEM classrooms and their intended majors. This research explores the effect of embedding small interventions designed to improve engineering pre-major students\u2019 sense of belonging and self-efficacy into traditionally taught Introduction to Engineering and Introduction to Engineering Physics classes. In addition, this study investigates the effect of the interventions on different student groups (women, first generation, students of color or ethnic background, community college vs. technical college vs. university students, etc.). This study has the potential to benefit first-year engineering education pedagogies by exploring the effectiveness of small interventions that can be embedded into busy course curriculums without significantly detracting from classroom time available for content directly connected to course outcomes. The three interventions used in this study include a first-day collaborative activity to establish classroom norms; a mid-quarter activity centered around growth mindset and metacognition; and a one-to-one instructor/student meeting. The effectiveness of the interventions on increasing sense of belonging is assessed using a series of five Likert scale questions drawn from other belongingness surveys found in the literature [2]. The pre-course survey was administered during the first week of the term with nine questions embedded in a broader \u201cGetting to Know You\u201d survey. The post-course survey was administered during the last week of the term with the same nine questions embedded in a broader survey collecting student feedback on the effectiveness of various course learning activities (e.g. homework, projects, lectures, etc). All work was completed with IRB approval and students identity protection. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis is being performed on the collected data. Researchers anticipate that the three interventions will improve student sense of belonging and will look to use the survey response data to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the interventions as perceived by the students.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 15, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "98659845", "name": "S.
