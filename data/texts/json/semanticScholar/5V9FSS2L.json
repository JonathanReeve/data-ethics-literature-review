While not all games are well suited for multiplayer play \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s hard to avoid getting in each other\u2019s way and impeding rather than advancing game progress\u2019 (p. 133) \u2013 most games are intended to be played while in the room with other people. \u2018The Wii is just the latest attempt by Nintendo to bring a version of this kind of social gaming into the living room, closer to arcade parties and karaoke than to, say, bouts of online multiplayer military simulations\u2019 (p. 142). Jones and Thiruvathukal\u2019s book is as much a user\u2019s manual for the potential of the Nintendo Wii as it is an academic and technical deconstruction of the console as a computing platform. Their joint approach to considering the topic works well, but it isn\u2019t until the very end of the book that Jones\u2019 cultural contextual approach really shines. In the final six pages of the sixth chapter (pp. 143\u2013148), the authors consider the paratext of the Wii, as well as the diegetic and nondiegetic elements of video games \u2013 and the various layers of the platform and the games, interactions and activities it supports. \u2018This social layer of a video game platform is an essential part of what the system means, because it\u2019s the environment in which the platform gets used\u2019 (p. 148). Much of the existing literature on Nintendo \u2013 such as Osamu Inoue\u2019s (2010) Nintendo Magic: Winning the Videogame Wars and Jeff Ryan\u2019s (2011) Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America \u2013 concentrates on the company\u2019s success as a business. The more technical literature to date focuses on the use of the Wii Balance Board, another controller for the platform, in healthcare and therapeutic settings. This text sits comfortably in the middle, Wiimote and Nunchuk controllers in hand, making a valuable contribution to the study of the Nintendo Wii and how technology and culture work together.", "venue": "New Media Soc.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 1, "citationCount": 777, "influentialCitationCount": 97, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2295688", "name": "L.
