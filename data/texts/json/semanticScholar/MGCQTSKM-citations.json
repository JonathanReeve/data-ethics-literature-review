Nevertheless, the still ongoing COVID-19 worldwide emergency definitely promoted a wide adoption of teleworking modalities for many people around the world, making it more relevant than before to understand the real impact of virtual environments (VEs) on teamwork dynamics. From a psychological point of view, a critical question about teleworking modalities is how the social and cognitive dynamics of collaborative facilitation and collaborative inhibition would affect teamwork within VEs. This study analyzed the impact of a virtual environment (VE) on the recall of individuals and members of nominal and collaborative groups. The research assessed costs and benefits for collaborative retrieval by testing the effect of experimental conditions, stimulus materials, group size, experimental conditions order, anxiety state, personality traits, gender group composition and social interactions. A total of 144 participants were engaged in a virtual Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) classical paradigm, which involved remembering word lists across two successive sessions, in one of four protocols: I-individual/nominal, I I -nominal/individual, I I I -nominal/collaborative, I V -collaborative/nominal. Results suggested, in general, a reduced collaborative inhibition effect in the collaborative condition than the nominal and individual condition. A combined effect between experimental condition and difficulty of the task appears to explain the presence of collaborative inhibition or facilitation. Nominal groups appeared to enhance the collaborative groups\u2019 performance when virtual nominal groups come before collaborative groups. Variables such as personality traits, gender and social interactions may have a contribution to collaborative retrieval. In conclusion, this study indicated how VEs could maintain those peculiar social dynamics characterizing the participants\u2019 engagement in a task, both working together and individually, and could affect their intrinsic motivation as well as performances. These results could be exploited in order to design brand new and evidenced-based practices, to improve teleworking procedures and workers well-being, as well as teleworking teamwork effectiveness.", "venue": "Future Internet", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3040140", "name": "A.

One of the most promising research fields is software testing, as many researchers found significant correlations between developers' experience and testing effectiveness. In this paper, we aim at further studying this relation, by focusing on how development teams' experience is associated with the assertion density, i.e., the number of assertions per test class KLOC, that has previously been shown as an effective way to decrease fault density. We perform a mixed-methods empirical study. First, we devise a statistical model relating development teams' experience and other control factors to the assertion density of test classes belonging to 12 software projects. This model enables us to investigate whether experience comes out as a statistically significant factor to explain assertion density. Second, we contrast the statistical findings with a survey study conducted with 57 developers, who were asked their opinions on how developer's experience is related to the way they add assertions in test code. Our findings suggest the existence of a relationship: on the one hand, the development team's experience is a statistically significant factor in most of the systems that we have investigated; on the other hand, developers confirm the importance of experience and team composition for the effective testing of production code.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 83, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "13721350", "name": "Gemma Catolino"}, {"authorId": "34946033", "name": "Fabio Palomba"}, {"authorId": "1702285", "name": "A.

So far, a few studies investigated the IPV dynamics by means of alternative approach in the field of social psychology such as agent-based modeling (ABM). The current research attempted to examine the dynamically interactive processes within IPV system by means of different methods (e.g., qualitative, quantitative and ABM) and tried to compare their results, in order to obtain a broader understanding of this phenomenon and the factors that might decrease it.

However, given the promise of collaboration, the intelligent tutoring systems community has begun to investigate the utility of computer-supported collaborative learning as a means for addressing traditional classroom impediments to collaborative learning. In particular, narrativecentered learning environments may be well equipped to address the complexities of collaboration. This paper discusses the advantages of narrative-centered learning environments for both student-student collaboration as well as student-agent collaboration.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "31942647", "name": "J.

This allowed us to study computer-mediated communication that was not part of a discussion group or chat room. An analysis of the e-mails revealed that males and females did not differ in frequency, length or use of social incentives. Males sent slightly more status enhancement messages while females sent more status recognition messages. Significant gender differences occurred, however, in the use of apologies and in how personal weaknesses or bad experiences were characterized. Unexpectedly, university affiliation was more significant than gender in the amount of self-disclosure.", "venue": "Int. J. Inf. Commun. Technol.
