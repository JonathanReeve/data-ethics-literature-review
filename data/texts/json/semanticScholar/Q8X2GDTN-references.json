Extrapolation from this regression equation yields a predicted group size for modern humans very similar to that of certain hunter-gatherer and traditional horticulturalist societies. Groups of similar size are also found in other large-scale forms of contemporary and historical society. Among primates, the cohesion of groups is maintained by social grooming; the time devoted to social grooming is linearly related to group size among the Old World monkeys and apes. To maintain the stability of the large groups characteristic of humans by grooming alone would place intolerable demands on time budgets. It is suggested that (1) the evolution of large groups in the human lineage depended on the development of a more efficient method for time-sharing the processes of social bonding and that (2) language uniquely fulfills this requirement. Data on the size of conversational and other small interacting groups of humans are in line with the predictions for the relative efficiency of conversation compared to grooming as a bonding process. Analysis of a sample of human conversations shows that about 60% of time is spent gossiping about relationships and personal experiences. It is suggested that language evolved to allow individuals to learn about the behavioural characteristics of other group members more rapidly than is possible by direct observation alone.", "venue": "", "year": 1993, "referenceCount": 274, "citationCount": 1687, "influentialCitationCount": 90, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144610599", "name": "Robin I.

The techniques are applied to analyze and visualize data recorded during events in virtual worlds, as well as simulated data, but are also applicable to real-world data. Resulting visualizations can and have been used to ease social navigation in 3D virtual worlds, help evaluate and optimize the design of virtual worlds, and provide a means to study the communities evolving in virtual worlds. The visualizations are particularly valuable for analyzing events that are spread out in time and/or space or events that involve a very large number of participants. The paper reviews and builds upon research in information visualization, scientific visualization, geography, architecture, and social science. It discusses intended user groups and their tasks and how the proposed techniques support those tasks. Three dimensional virtual world technologies are briefly described before the visualization tool set is explained in detail together with sample applications.

Game developers have made great strides in achieving game worlds that look and feel increasingly realistic. However, despite these achievements in the visual realism of virtual game worlds, they are much less sophisticated when it comes to modeling face-to-face interaction. In face-to-face, ordinary social activities are \u201caccountable,\u201d that is, people use a variety of kinds of observational information about what others are doing in order to make sense of others\u2019 actions and to tightly coordinate their own actions with others. Such information includes: (1) the real-time unfolding of turns-at-talk; (2) the observability of embodied activities; and (3) the direction of eye gaze for the purpose of gesturing. But despite the fact that today\u2019s games provide virtual bodies, or \u201cavatars,\u201d for players to control, these avatars display much less information about players\u2019 current state than real bodies do.
