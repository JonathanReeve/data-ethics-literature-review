Most standard macroeconomic models, however, assume that markets are perfectly competitive. This paper provides a simple framework in which we are able to explore some of the implications of imperfect competition for the macroeconomy, and to evaluate the adequacy of competitive macroeconomic models as \"convenient simplifications\". results of the paper suggest that whilst some general features of competitive macromodels do carry over to an imperfectly competitive framework, others do not. Imperfect competition in the labour and product market can have a significant impact on the level of employment and the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy. Imperfect competition provides an explicit account of price and wage determination, and thus gives us a far greater insight into the macroeconomic structure of macroeconomic equilibrium than is possible in competitive models. This paper presents a simple model of imperfect competition with Walrasian features. The model is \"Walrasian\" both in some of its assumptions,0 and also in the properties of the model. What we have attempted to do is to take a standard neoclassical synthesis macromodel (e.g. Patinkin (1965), Branson (1979)) and introduce imperfect competition into the product and labour markets. We feel that this is a useful exercise for two reasons. Firstly, it provides a simple macro model of imperfect competition in which the causal mechanisms are very clear. In general, models of imperfect competition have tended to be rather complex, despite a recent trend towards simpler versions (e.g. Hart (1982), d'Aspremont et al. (1985)). Secondly, by adopting the standard neoclassical synthesis framework, it is easy to relate the model of imperfect competition to more familiar models. Imperfect competition in the product is modelled using conjecturalvariations Cournot equilibrium which captures a wide range of possible market solutions, encompassing perfect competition, Cournot, and joint profit maximisation as special cases.

The available worker history makes it possible to mine workers' preference on tasks and to provide favorite recommendations. Our exploratory study on the survey results collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) shows that workers' histories can reflect workers' preferences on tasks in crowdsourcing systems. Task recommendation can help workers to find their right tasks faster as well as help requesters to receive good quality output quicker. However, previously proposed classification based task recommendation approach only considers worker performance history, but does not explore worker task searching history. In our paper, we propose a task recommendation framework for task preference modeling and preference-based task recommendation, aiming to recommend tasks to workers who are likely to prefer to work on and provide output that accepted by requesters. We consider both worker performance history and worker task searching history to reflect workers' task preference more accurately.

In contrast with previous work, we found that network topology had no significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement between connected neighbors. We then tested both of these possibilities in two subsequent series of experiments in which artificial \"seed\" players were introduced, making either full or zero contributions. First, we found that although players did generally behave like conditional cooperators, they were as likely to decrease their contributions in response to low contributing neighbors as they were to increase their contributions in response to high contributing neighbors.

Street prices of diverted prescription opioids can provide an indicator of drug availability, demand, and abuse potential, but these data can be difficult to collect. Crowdsourcing is a rapid and cost-effective way to gather information about sales transactions. We sought to determine whether crowdsourcing can provide accurate measurements of the street price of diverted prescription opioid medications. Objective To assess the possibility of crowdsourcing black market drug price data by cross-validation with law enforcement officer reports. Methods Using a crowdsourcing research website (StreetRx), we solicited data about the price that site visitors paid for diverted prescription opioid analgesics during the first half of 2012. These results were compared with a survey of law enforcement officers in the Researched Abuse, Diversion, and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS) System, and actual transaction prices on a \u201cdark Internet\u201d marketplace (Silk Road). Geometric means and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for comparing prices per milligram of drug in US dollars. In a secondary analysis, we compared prices per milligram of morphine equivalent using standard equianalgesic dosing conversions. Results A total of 954 price reports were obtained from crowdsourcing, 737 from law enforcement, and 147 from the online marketplace. Correlations between the 3 data sources were highly linear, with Spearman rho of 0.93 (P<.001) between crowdsourced and law enforcement, and 0.98 (P<.001) between crowdsourced and online marketplace. On StreetRx, the mean prices per milligram were US$3.29 hydromorphone, US$2.13 buprenorphine, US$1.57 oxymorphone, US$0.97 oxycodone, US$0.96 methadone, US$0.81 hydrocodone, US$0.52 morphine, and US$0.05 tramadol. The only significant difference between data sources was morphine, with a Drug Diversion price of US$0.67/mg (95% CI 0.59-0.75) and a Silk Road price of US$0.42/mg (95% CI 0.37-0.48). Street prices generally followed clinical equianalgesic potency. Conclusions Crowdsourced data provide a valid estimate of the street price of diverted prescription opioids.

Although the defeat of PATCO was extremely important, the undermining of construction unionism, spearheaded by the Business Roundtable, was happening in the 1970s, and the beginning of concessions by major unions occurred in that same decade, the most prominent example being the 1979 contract concluded between the UAW and Chrysler as part of Chrysler's bailout package. Nor, on the other side, was BASF the only dramatic victory for labor in the complex industrial relations landscape of the 1980s: Pittston coal miners, New York State electrical workers, and Las Vegas hotel workers, among others, registered important gains, after major strikes. Facts about any individual labor victory or defeat, while often highly illuminating, are rarely if ever a projection in miniature of the trajec-tory of U.S. labor relations. Minchin's detailed account of the struggle around the 1980s lock-out at BASF is an important piece of recent labor history (which I heartily recommend to everyone interested in the subject), but it must be put into a broader context to be fully understood. \u2026another bad case of monopsony in motion \u2026 monopsony can break your heart \u2026 the capitalists will rue the day when workers win their way. The haunting electronic beltings of John DiNardo, in what has to be the only theme song ever written for an economics book, might send a shiver down the spine of the most conservative neo-classical labor economist. Beyond its entertainment value\u2014it will surely convince a few people that advanced material in labor economics is not always somniferous\u2014I believe the song is a shot across the bow of perfect competition's ship, as Alan Manning sets sail to challenge a number of accepted explanations of stylized facts in labor economics. What would you do if your employer cut your hourly wage by one cent? \" Lace up my running shoes and sprint for the nearest office exit, \" you might say, parrying a silly question with a silly answer. And yet such questions naturally arise when one assumes that all firms operate in perfectly competitive labor markets. The one-cent-per-hour wage cut is, in fact, the seemingly daft example with which Alan Manning introduces Monopsony in Motion and sets the stage for his careful examination of the various puzzling implications of taking perfect competition as the baseline when thinking of how the labor market operates. Manning emphasizes that blind adherence to the perfectly competitive \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 634, "influentialCitationCount": 96, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "7788790", "name": "M.
