The focus is on the creation of policy discourse on communication issues taking place in intergovernmental settings. In order to compare or evaluate policy initiatives, we need to understand how initiatives come about in the complex and highly politicized settings of international organizations that have the particularity of regrouping actors with very diverse backgrounds and interests. But instead of analyzing the interests, ideas and power relations of the individual and organizational actors involved, the paper proposes to look at policy ideas as the outcome of discursive struggles among networks of actors. It not simply asks which ideas are taken up in policy debates, but questions how it comes that certain ideas come to be adopted as the dominant thinking in intergovernmental policy-making bodies. Based on a critical review of Foucault\u2019s notions of discourse, knowledge and power, the paper elaborates a methodological approach that combines Argumentative Discourse Analysis (ADA) \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 initiated as Argumentative Policy Analysis by Frank Fischer and John Forester and further developed by Marteen Hajer \u2013 with the conceptual ideas of Actor-Network Theory (ANT), as developed by Michel Callon, Bruno Latour and John Law.

Many Voices, One World was a groundbreaking report and became a milestone in the discussions that had been ongoing since the 1970s. We examine its insights in the light of debates leading up and subsequent to the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005. We argue that many of the issues and dilemmas highlighted by the MacBride Report\u2019s authors exist today. The record of WSIS participants in tackling these issues is unfortunately little better than that of those who sought to inouence debates about media and communication some twenty-ave years ago. Although there has been much talk in the intervening years, there are few signs that international debates and diplomatic mechanisms are fostering the equitable development of the media and communication environment that is so crucial for the emergence of information societies in the twenty-arst century. There is a profusion of smaller and larger initiatives aimed at reducing various social and economic inequalities including those associated with the media and communication industries. In our view, however, it is unlikely that the new institutional forums that have emerged since the WSIS will be equal to addressing sources of inequality in areas such as governance, anancing, media diversity, freedom of speech, and human rights. Nevertheless, and partly as a result of the WSIS dialogue, participants in civil society are becoming better informed about the issues involved. Whereas the WSIS, as the MacBride Commission before it, failed to galvanize private and public sector participants into action to promote the massive investment that is needed, the WSIS process did heighten the proale of core international media and communication issues in many key international forums.

Based on research in the USA, Asia, Latin America, and Europe, it aims to formulate a systematic theory of the information society which takes account of the fundamental effects of information technology on the contemporary world. \nThe global economy is now characterized by the almost instantaneous flow and exchange of information, capital and cultural communication. These flows order and condition both consumption and production. The networks themselves reflect and create distinctive cultures. Both they and the traffic they carry are largely outside national regulation. Our dependence on the new modes of informational flow gives enormous power to those in a position to control them to control us. The main political arena is now the media, and the media are not politically answerable. \nManuel Castells describes the accelerating pace of innovation and application. He examines the processes of globalization that have marginalized and now threaten to make redundant whole countries and peoples excluded from informational networks. He investigates the culture, institutions and organizations of the network enterprise and the concomitant transformation of work and employment. He points out that in the advanced economies production is now concentrated on an educated section of the population aged between 25 and 40: many economies can do without a third or more of their people. He suggests that the effect of this accelerating trend may be less mass unemployment than the extreme flexibilization of work and individualization of labor, and, in consequence, a highly segmented socialstructure. \nThe author concludes by examining the effects and implications of technological change on mass media culture (\"the culture of real virtuality\"), on urban life, global politics, and the nature of time and history.

Taking a critical stance on neo-liberal policy positions that dominated international debates at that time, most speakers at the conferences challenged the market-dominated vision of an Information Society and called instead for a more participatory model that reflected the demands and needs of users. In the following years, UNESCO publicly defended highly contested issues as \u2018fair use\u2019 exemptions to copyright in the digital environment or the idea of information being a global common good, and started to work on a related intergovernmental recommendation. This provoked fierce reactions by a number of member states and observers, which considered UNESCO\u2019s efforts as a thread to their economic, political and cultural interests. As a consequence, the recommendation was only adopted after various consultation rounds had resulted in major refining of the most contested paragraphs. The paper retraces the history of UNESCO\u2019s search for global ethical values in the new informational environment as a struggle over divergent visions of an Information Society.

Michael McCann (1994, p. 6) refers to a related body of literature which describes law as discourse.
