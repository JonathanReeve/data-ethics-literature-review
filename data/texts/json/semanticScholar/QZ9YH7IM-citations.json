We propose that journal transition can be seen as falling into three categories. The first is enhanced models of the traditional scholarly journal, which typically afford enriched functionality that breaks the bonds of the printed page whilst otherwise remaining wholly traditional in their offerings. The second category is innovative models of the traditional scholarly journal, which aim at supporting the journal in performing its traditional roles through convention\u2010altering ways. The third category is the possible alternatives to the traditional journal, which represent a move towards alternative modes of knowledge dissemination.

Sleep debt is associated with maladaptive physiological changes that can lead to cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric pathologies.

To test this hypothesis, we assessed hepatic metabolic profiles of rats after 5days of SR using UPLC-MS based metabolomics analysis and gene expression analysis. Our data suggests distinctive effects of SR on the liver metabolic profile of rats compared to forced-activity control animals. We observed specific impacts of SR on NAD metabolism through NAD accumulation and upregulation of Nampt, the rate determining step of NAD salvage. Additional multi-omic changes were observed in methionine metabolism, with an elevated SAM:SAH ratio under SR. This effect on one carbon metabolism is indicative of increased methylation potential. Changes in TCA cycle intermediates and ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) gene expression were observed that may be related to altered circulatory lipid profiles previously reported documenting the chrono-metabolic connection. Taken together with previous investigations, these observations are consistent with a model of decreased TCA activity with concomitant increase in lipogenesis induced by SR.

Many medical journals operate companion blogs (an application of e-learning technology) that enable rapid dissemination of scientific knowledge and discourse. Faculty members participating in promotion and tenure academic tracks spend valuable time and effort contributing, editing, and directing these medical journal blogs. Objective We sought to understand whether chairs of medicine and pediatric departments acknowledge blog authorship as academic achievement. Methods The authors surveyed 267 chairs of US and Canadian medicine and pediatric departments regarding their attitudes toward the role of faculty participation in e-learning and blogging in the promotion and tenure process. The survey completion rate was 22.8% (61/267). Results A majority of respondents (87%, 53/61) viewed educational scholarship as either important or very important for promotion. However, only 23% (14/61) perceived importance to faculty effort in producing content for journal-based blogs. If faculty were to participate in blog authorship, 72% (44/61) of surveyed chairs favored involvement in a journal-based versus a society-based or a personal (nonaffiliated) blog. We identified a \u201cfavorable group\u201d of chairs (19/59, 32%), who rated leadership roles in e-learning tools as important or very important, and an \u201cunfavorable group\u201d of chairs (40/59, 68%), who rated leadership roles in e-learning tools as somewhat important or not important.

The first two academic journals appeared in Europe in 1655: the Parisian Journal des s\u00e7avans, which included a range of content from scientific material to legal reports, and the English The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which was published at its editor\u2019s personal expense and included contributions by Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, and Isaac Newton. In Russia, the first scholarly journal was published in Latin (with selected pieces translated into Russian) as Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae. It was housed at the newly founded St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, a pet project of Peter the Great and philosopher G.W. Leibniz, and was released in 14 volumes between 1726 and 1746. By the late-imperial period, the system of scholarly periodicals in the Russian Empire had developed into a broad network covering nearly all popular academic disciplines of the day; for instance, in the field of philosophy (which included psychology), there were roughly 20\u201325 journals in active publication at any given time during the first 15 years of the twentieth century. However, with the unrest and revolutions of the early twentieth century came the rapid collapse of this scholarly infrastructure: by 1920, the number of active journals in philosophy had fallen to zero and the number of journals on Russian/Soviet territory did not reach five until after Stalin\u2019s death in 1953. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian journals have experienced a period of turmoil and investment that mirrors the broader history of the country itself. The Russian scholarly community has seen the explosion of short-lived, independent journals in the first half of the 1990s; the collapse of that system in the second half of the 1990s following political and financial default; the rapid expansion of online and print journals in the 2000s; and the widespread adoption of subscription databases by institutions of higher education in the 2010s, which have brought Russian regional publications to Moscow as well as an extensive selection of international journals to leading universities (that can afford them) across Russia. The Russian scholarly community has also made great strides in establishing local databases of Russian-language periodicals, either through the controversial list of \u201cleading journals\u201d released by the Higher Attestation Commission (VAK), a national government agency that sets standards for the awarding of advanced academic degrees, or through the development of academic citation indexing and search services based on bibliographic content available through the electronic academic library eLIBRARY.ru. Moreover, at present the role and future of the academic journal as a vehicle of scholarly communication is at the center of the debates around higher education effectiveness and reform in Russia. Journals have become the favorite assessment tool of VAK, which certifies a limited list of journals (2269 titles in all disciplines as of 2014) and requires that each graduate student in the sciences or humanities has a minimum of three publications (as of 2014) in VAK-approved journals to be eligible for the candidate\u2019s degree.

Traditional measures, such as the impact factor of the journal that a researcher publishes in, may not be an appropriate or accurate means of assessing the overall output of an individual. The development of altmetrics offers the potential for fuller assessments of a researcher\u2019s output based on both their traditional and non-traditional scholarly outputs. New tools should make it easier to include non-traditional outputs such as data, software and contributions to peer review in the evaluation of earlyand mid-career researchers. Academic researchers work on highly specialized projects which are, by nature, at the limits of current understanding. When it comes to evaluating the quality of a researcher\u2019s work for promotion or other purposes, the esoteric nature of the work being assessed means that a proxy measure for the quality of the research is often used. The number of times a particular work has been cited has traditionally been used to measure the quality of a researcher\u2019s output relative to others in the same fi eld. However, an article\u2019s citation rate is no longer the only metric available to assess scholarly impact. In addition, the formally recognized output of scholarly research is also changing. The peer-reviewed article is no longer the sole measure by which a researcher\u2019s productivity can be assessed. The generation of scientifi c data, the coding of useful software, and contributions to the peer-review process are increasingly recognized as being vital to scientifi c progress. In this paper we discuss the changing nature of accreditation for scholarly work. We begin with a brief overview of the existing and emerging metrics for assessing the impact of the traditional scholarly output, the article. We provide an overview of the novel outputs being increasingly formally recognized and discuss how the emerging impact metrics might be applied to these. We end by discussing how metrics and research outputs might feed into current assessment processes. Citation-dependent measures of impact A journal\u2019s impact factor, as defi ned and calculated by Thomson\u2019s Journal Citation Reports (JCR; thomsonreuters.com/journalcitation-reports), is the mean number of citations for all the articles published in a particular journal in the preceding two years and is extrapolated to indicate the likely quality of the research published by that journal in subsequent years. Journal impact factors are often used as a proxy for forecasting the quality and \u00a9 Varsha K. Khodiyar, Karen A. Rowlett and Rebecca N. Lawrence 2014 Rebecca N. Lawrence Karen A.

Lawrence LEARNED PUBLISHING VOL. 27 SPECIAL ISSUE SEPTEMBER 2014 impact of future work that will be produced by the scientists who have previously published in these journals. This forecasting of a researcher\u2019s future productivity is used during hiring and promotion processes, as well as for other activities such as evaluating funding proposals. Thus the impact factor of the journal in which a paper is published can have a bearing on the career prospects of the authors of that paper. However, the use of journal impact factors for researcher evaluation is not ideal. As impact factors depend on an average, extreme deviations from the mean can signifi cantly skew the resultant impact factor. Because of the way impact factors are calculated (using article citation counts), the citation counts of articles published in a particular journal have been shown to correlate with the journal impact factor (Hansen and Henriksen 1997). However, a lack of correlation between the impact of an individual research paper and the impact factor of the journal in which it was published has also been well documented (Seglen 1997, Hecht et al. 1998, RostamiHodjegan and Tucker 2001, Tort et al. 2012, Casadevall and Fang 2014). Another problem with the use of the impact factor for judging research impact is that there is often a time lag before citations to an article begin to appear, with the maximum number of citations per year usually appearing 3\u20137 years after publication (Hansen and Henriksen 1997). Thus these later citations will not contribute to a journal\u2019s impact factor. The Eigenfactor Score and the Article Infl uence Score have been developed by the Eigenfactor Project as alternative (and openly available) measures to the JCR impact factors (Bergstrom et al. 2008). Although based on JCR data, the Article Infl uence score for a journal is a normalized measure of the average infl uence of each of its articles over the fi rst 5 years after publication and so addresses the citation time lag that can occur. The use of the journal impact factor for research evaluation also relies on an underlying assumption of the citation count having a direct correlation to quality. The assumption that papers published in highly selective journals with high impact factors will be of higher quality and correspondingly have higher rates of citation is not necessarily correct. It is possible that highly cited papers are being cited due to their fi ndings being questioned, as shown by Aksnes (2006). In recognition of the limited usefulness of the impact factor, researcher-centric metrics have been developed in an attempt to provide more direct measures of the quality of an individual researcher\u2019s output. The h-index was developed to measure both the productivity and impact of an individual, based on the number of articles that they have published and the number of citations those publications have received (Hirsch 2005). Whether the h-index is better or worse than using journal impact factors for predicting a researcher\u2019s future productivity is unclear (Lehmann et al. 2006, Hirsch 2007, Penner et al. 2013). Several modifi ed versions of the h-index have also been developed, e.g. Google Scholar\u2019s i10-index. A detailed discussion of these variations is outside the scope of this paper. However a drawback of any metric relying on article citations is the length of time it takes for the citations to accumulate, with the effect that mid-to-late career scientists will have a higher measured impact than earlycareer researchers. As it is the early-career researchers who are likely to be undergoing promotional evaluation, earlier measures of research impact are required. Citation-independent measures of impact The emergence of the Internet in the 1990s and associated development of novel methods of disseminating research articles, allowed the development of citation-independent measures of scholarly impact. In addition, the availability of usage data at the article level supported the development of metrics measuring the impact of individual articles as opposed to journal averages (Neylon and Wu 2009). PLOS has collated and displayed several article-level metrics (ALMs) for its published articles since 2009 (Fenner 2013). PLOS ALMs report usage statistics, comments on articles in forums and on social media, social book-marking statistics and expert recommendations, alongside citations (Fenner 2013). The term \u2018altmetrics\u2019 was coined in 2010 as a grouping term for these alternatives to citation-dependent and journal-level metrics (Priem et al. 2012), but is sometimes also used as short-hand for article-level metrics. a lack of correlation between the impact of an individual paper and the journal has been well documented Altmetrics as a means of assessing scholarly output S27 LEARNED PUBLISHING VOL. 27 SPECIAL ISSUE SEPTEMBER 2014 In this paper we use the \u2018alternative metrics\u2019 (non-citation based) defi nition of altmetrics, and discuss the application of altmetrics to articles as well as to other outputs of scholarly research. In general terms, these alternative measures seek to judge the impact of a research output by examining the number of times that it is viewed, downloaded, saved, discussed by the scientifi c community, and recommended to others. The most commonly implemented altmetrics for online scholarly publications are simple counts of the numbers of views and downloads (Figure 1). In order to standardize the way in which online usage is presented, some journals may adhere to standards such as COUNTER (www.projectcounter.org) when assessing the number of views and downloads in order to exclude any possible \u2018gaming\u2019 activity due to robots. Additional altmetrics can include the number of times an article has been shared via email or social media platforms such as Twitter, mentioned in blogs or added to citation management tools such as CiteULike (www.citeulike.org) or Mendeley (www.mendeley.com). These are now well-established article-level metrics that have been implemented by many publishers and can be provided by companies such as Altmetric (www.altmetric.com) or generated in-house. Key advantages of altmetrics include the fact that they begin to accumulate as soon as the article is published, and that they are independent of the altmetrics being generated for any other article published in the same journal at the same time. Additionally, several studies have showed a signifi cant correlation between altmetrics and traditional measures of impact Figure 1.

Our discussion reports on how different editorial and collaborative review processes improved data documentation and quality, and created ontology annotations needed for comparative analyses by domain specialists. To prepare data for shared analysis, this project adapted editor-supervised review and revision processes familiar to conventional publishing, as well as more novel models of revision adapted from open source software development of public version control. Preparing the datasets for publication and analysis required significant investment of effort and expertise, including archaeological domain knowledge and familiarity with key ontologies. To organize this work effectively, we emphasized these different models of collaboration at various stages of this data publication and analysis project. Collaboration first centered on data editors working with data contributors, then widened to include other researchers who provided additional peer-review feedback, and finally the widest research community, whose collaboration is facilitated by GitHub\u2019s version control system. We demonstrate that the \u201cpublish\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d models of data dissemination need not be mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they can play complementary roles in sharing high quality data in support of research.
