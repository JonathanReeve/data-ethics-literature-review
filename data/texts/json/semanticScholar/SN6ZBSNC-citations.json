This includes greater transparency about data, and accountability for decisions made when developing it. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous framework for dataset development transparency that supports decision-making and accountability. The framework uses the cyclical, infrastructural and engineering nature of dataset development to draw on best practices from the software development lifecycle. Each stage of the data development lifecycle yields documents that facilitate improved communication and decision-making, as well as drawing attention to the value and necessity of careful data work. The proposed framework makes visible the often overlooked work and decisions that go into dataset creation, a critical step in closing the accountability gap in artificial intelligence and a critical/necessary resource aligned with recent work on auditing processes.", "venue": "FAccT", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 258, "citationCount": 30, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2083807", "name": "B.

Members of this group comprise roughly 13% of the U.S. population, but disproportionately hold only 5% and 8% of computer engineering and computer science bachelor?s degrees. Studies suggest that computing culture and stereotypes associated with the discipline and its practitioners are among the varied contributors to sociocultural rifts between Black students and computing. This disconnect impacts students' computational and technological identities, which may result in these students deciding to \"disidentify\" with computing, and to pursue academic disciplines in which they experience higher self-efficacy. Despite comprising only 4% of U.S. universities, Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) produce 31% of the Black STEM bachelor's degrees. Still, HBCU computing departments face unique retention issues that impact student matriculation through computer science (CS) degrees. As there are few course-based efforts geared toward cultivating students' computing identities, this position paper highlights the need for formal attention to the fostering of these identities. It presents HBCU computing departments as key centers for beginning to address traditional computing culture and identity-related attrition issues for Black students.

In 1998, Richard A. Lippa [29] uncovered a relationship between gender and preference within the People\u2013Things spectrum, with women preferring People-oriented activities to a higher degree than men. The aim of this paper is twofold. First of all, we wish to determine if a similar relation can be established in the particular context of computing educational activities. Second of all, we wish to see if Lippa\u2019s findings can be extrapolated to contemporary high-school students. To do that, we designed and conducted an experiment involving around 500 Danish high-school students who have been asked to choose between a People-themed version vs an isomorphic Things-themed version of four activities representative for computing education. The results show that the odds of a woman preferring a task involving People is 2.7 times higher than those of a man. The odds of a student without prior programming experience preferring a task involving People is 1.4 times higher than those of a student with programming experience. If we compare women without programming experience to men with programming experience the effect is even more pronounced; indeed, the combined effect is 3.8 (2.7 \u00d7 1.4). Our study implies a recommendation for computing educators to, whenever possible, favor educational activities involving People over Things. This makes educational activities appeal more to female students (and to students without programming experience), while not making a difference for male students (or students with programming experience).

Research suggests a correlation between team diversity and innovation. Within this context, collaboration, open dialog, and multiple voices from diverse backgrounds facilitate innovation. Over the past few decades, teams have increased in size while becoming more reflective of the globalization of knowledge work, harnessing the power of diverse points of view. Team size and the increased complexity of published research are illustrated in lengthy lists of authors with some journals now including metadata about authors\u2019 contributions. While disciplines vary in how authorship is credited, it is common to include all team members because the research is due to collective contributions. Authorship is important to researchers\u2019 careers both as credit for contribution to the team and to communicate connection to one\u2019s coauthors, which often leads to future collaboration invitations. In our current reality of physical isolation, with conferences moving online, coauthorships are even more important for professional networking.

Hand in hand with the masculinization of the programmer, digital technologies and code itself became endowed with an aura of rationality and detachment\u2014that is, masculinity (Adam, 1998; Ensmenger, 2010, 2015). Media theorist Wendy Chun\u2019s (2011: xii, 2) analysis of computers as \u2018mediums of power\u2019 offers an explanation for why the critiques of Annett\u2019s computerized methods further weakened her precarious position in the field instead of transferring the authority of alleged masculine rationality to Annett\u2019s model. Chun (2011: xii, 2, 20) suggested that computers empower users to envision, create, and \u2018navigate [their] increasingly complex world\u2019 while simultaneously imposing on them the demands of \u2018neoliberal governmental power\u2019; in other words, users are both \u2018empower[ed]\u2019 and \u2018estrange[d]\u2019. While Chun\u2019s analysis focuses on 21st-century computer users, the idea that computers confer power on users and stabilize existing power dynamics held equally true for Annett and McManus. In Annett\u2019s case, the latter characteristic outweighed the former. She was already marginalized as an older female clinical psychologist without a professorship. Moreover, she had never been educated in the use of computers and did not have immediate access to them, and her colleagues rejected her expertise in the use of masculine-coded machines. In contrast, McManus began using computers while on \u2018a long vacation course in pharmacology in Cambridge in 1970\u2019 and honed his skills in using them during his free time, and his credibility as a male MD/PhD benefitted significantly from seemingly rational and detached computational analyses.(23) Annett was not particularly computer-savvy, but computers promised to facilitate her statistical calculations.(24) Towards the beginning of her career, she carried out calculations by hand, at home, often over the course of several days. For the RS theory, Annett used computers to operationalize the most laborious calculations with help from computer scientists and her son. For her most-cited paper, Annett (1970) used a computerized association analysis to hone the distinction between the three presumed handedness phenotypes and give them empirical weight.", "Electronic computers were a matter of national security and economic productivity, and computer programming, which had been considered women\u2019s work before, became an increasingly male domain from the 1960s onwards (Abbate, 2012; Hicks, 2017; Misa, 2010; Morley and McDonnell, 2015)."], "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "4eb16d35d3606a0b9a8b1b4d401ecad74d1f6deb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3084936977", "DOI": "10.1177/0952695120944031"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4eb16d35d3606a0b9a8b1b4d401ecad74d1f6deb", "title": "An even-handed debate?

In the 1860s, Paul Broca suggested that the speech centre sat in the left brain hemisphere in most humans, and that right-handedness stemmed from this asymmetry. One century later, British psychologists Marian Annett and Chris McManus proposed biologically unconfirmed theories of how handedness and brain asymmetry were passed on in families. Their idea to integrate chance into genetic models of handedness was novel, and so was their use of computerized statistics to parse out the incidence of handedness genotypes and phenotypes. Notwithstanding significant conceptual and methodological overlaps, McManus and Annett did not collaborate and proposed competing theories. I analyse the sexed/gendered dimensions of their controversy by drawing on published literature, unpublished documents, and oral history interviews. I first attend to the epistemological importance of sex/gender. Both psychologists published several iterations of their models, which increasingly relied on questions of sex/gender and reproduction. Annett additionally linked handedness with stereotypically gendered cognitive abilities. Second, I argue that using masculine-coded computer technologies contributed to Annett\u2019s professional marginalization whereas similar methods endowed McManus with surplus authority. Finally, I show that Annett\u2019s complicity in stabilizing sociocultural hierarchies within her theory mirrored her personal experience of marginalization based on sex/gender, age, education, and lack of institutional affiliation.

What I call \u2018experimental hip-hop\u2019 emerged with a number of musical innovators, mostly based in Los Angeles, and has since spread globally, including to London, the main site of my investigations. The musicians who make this music are usually termed \u2018producers\u2019 or \u2018beatmakers\u2019, and they employ their laptops along with other instruments and music technologies to create their compositions, usually in bedroom studios. While this style has much in common with more traditional forms of hip-hop, producers have increasingly released instrumental pieces as compositions in their own right (rather than as backing tracks for rappers and MCs), and focused on creating different kinds of musical complexity. Producers deploy an array of innovative practices alongside more traditional ones, such as sampling. Drawing on a richly varied methodology, including long-form semi-structured interviews, participant observation of studio practices, and an examination of the creation of pre-composed musical materials, I analyse the role of human and non- human actors in the ways knowledge is transmitted. It is worth noting at this point that this thesis is a study of musical and technical knowledge rather than a number of forms of knowledge examined in Afrodiasporic and post-colonial scholarship. Throughout I argue that producers learn from both technologies and their peers, and that this approach to learning seems distinct from the kinds of formal and informal teacher- student relationships that exist in other forms of music making. This means that the musicians I study must not only be formidable autodidacts, but also able to build strong bonds with other producers to help them to help them vie for distinction in a musical landscape in which particular forms of compositional complexity are highly valued.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 287, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2037318286", "name": "Daniel Gouly"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "742b99a43fd4a5194ff49b7a2b98cb8b3dd11ead", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/fie/HolandaMBRAW20", "MAG": "3112370129", "DOI": "10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274257"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/742b99a43fd4a5194ff49b7a2b98cb8b3dd11ead", "title": "What do Female Students in Middle and High Schools Think about Computer Science Majors in Brasilia, Brazil?

DERR Dissertation Director: Elizabeth R. Petrick, PH.D. Computer technology has not always been dominated by men. Prior to 1984, women earning computer science degrees skyrocketed to nearly 37%. After this peak, the numbers dwindled down to just 17% by 2012. What happened here? This paper tells the story of how women grew to become more and more marginalized not only from computing, but from the culture of video games that would become extremely popular as home computers became more available to the public. This story traces how gender roles and stereotypes go on to gatekeep women from participating in video game and computer culture from the 1970s and well into the 2000s and beyond. This gatekeeping is perpetuated through the attitudes and perspectives of men who were typically the developers of computer hardware, software and video games. Public attitudes on violence and sexuality also contributed to the stereotyping of both young boys and girls, which was further reinforced through the narratives of the media. This story aims to provide agency to the voices of female gamers who were overlooked in their contemporary culture as well as in the vast history of video games.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2119330379", "name": "Thomas M.

Gamergate continues to intensify a heightened climate of hostility especially felt by women and minorities.This ongoing feminist ethnography has emerged from an imperative to create interventions into the increasing normalisation of online and offline harassment. In it, this research analyses the affective labour of how people navigate and \u2018cope\u2019 with discrimination in gaming cultures. \nThis paper will present vignettes of the larger research project of how online harassment has coloured people\u2019s lived experiences, through thick-descriptions of in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with 7 women who play videogames with their romantic partners. These interviews gesture towards a rich complexity of affective relationships at the nexus of gaming, romantic relationships, and the everyday lived experiences of women. To avoid bringing attention to their gender, harassment, and unwanted confrontations, women are hypervigilant. In similar ways to self-defence tactics, women constantly avoid using headsets to communicate with other players, keep clear of conversations about playing videogames, and minimise the performance of their femininity in public gaming spaces.This paper critically examines the dynamics of how the increasing normalisation and public gamification of online harassment impacts women\u2019s engagement with gaming, as well as how \u2018online\u2019 harassment may invade into their intimate relationships and domestic \u2018private\u2019 spheres.", "venue": "AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "27010503", "name": "M.

Abbate shows how women working on the Colossus and ENIAC projects had similar experiences in the sense that they were underestimated by their project leaders and relegated to positions that were thought to be rote and unskilled. However, there were several major differences between the American and British projects that influenced the postwar prospects of the women who worked on them including divisions of labor, training models, and levels of secrecy. The Colossus computers were literally dismantled after the war, and the women who worked on them sworn to a lifetime of secrecy thanks to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. On the other hand, the ENIAC women had the option to continue working, and many of them did, with some going on to distinguished careers in computing. Despite these success stories, American women as a whole went on to face a highly discriminatory workplace in the postwar era, albeit not in the rigidly institutionalized manner found in the British context. Instead of relegating women to specific, low-wage job classes in government like the British did, Abbate shows how employers in the United States relied on socially constructed conceptualizations of (and proxies for) skill to keep women and other marginalized groups out of higher-wage and management-level positions in computing firms.

The primary goal of this study is to identify the differences in expressions of sentiments between male and female developers during various software engineering tasks. On this goal, we mined the code review repositories of six popular open source projects. We used a semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as multiple social networks to identify the gender of a developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering domain, we classify each communication as negative, positive, or neutral. We also compute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by each developer.Our results suggest that the likelihood of using sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on the gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express sentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their male colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the six projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also withholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Our results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative work place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.", "venue": "2019 IEEE 26th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount": 21, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3253198", "name": "Rajshakhar Paul"}, {"authorId": "2517154", "name": "Amiangshu Bosu"}, {"authorId": "1739877", "name": "Kazi Zakia Sultana"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "d8b07683849fa317caee800fb85407bf8597b734", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3017691963", "DOI": "10.1201/9780429330704"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d8b07683849fa317caee800fb85407bf8597b734", "title": "Teaching Tech Together", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 560, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2070347334", "name": "G.

Internal teams within companies make impossible decisions daily about what to permit and how to word and implement standards.

Volunteer user moderators manage whole communities for no compensation beyond a sense of contributing to something meaningful. Though it would be impossible for humans to moderate all content on Facebook, an enormous number of large and small decisions are far out of reach for algorithms. Following the discussion of the aforementioned breastfeeding photo saga and the complexities of decisions on whether to filter or remove different types of content, Gillespie closes with a discussion of the future of content moderation. Platforms sit in an unenviable position where users expect both protection from other users and the freedom to express themselves as they see fit. The current system may be technically viable moving into the future, at least if companies are given the opportunity to hire small armies of content moderator contractors, but it is certainly not politically viable given ever-growing pressure from different stakeholders with conflicting interests. In the final chapter, Gillespie summarizes the heart of his argument where he presents possible avenues to address some of the major problems in content moderation. Readers following the debates about content moderation will be familiar with some of Gillespie\u2019s recommendations, such as his call for more diversity in platform hires and a shift toward new business models, but there are a few details that push common discussion points in new directions. For example, Gillespie recommends building transparency directly into user interfaces, where unobtrusive notices could help us understand moderation-related actions happening around us. Similarly, he suggests that users might benefit from the fruits of their own moderation labor, which in this case means accessing aggregated data about what has been flagged. These are both categories of features that are plausible to implement and benefit users without giving up too much in the way of information about internal processes. Custodians of the Internet is written to be accessible to scholars, designers, engineers, executives, journalists, and policymakers from a wide variety of backgrounds, and each has something to gain from reading it. It covers the main content moderation categories, though there the spread of disinformation is only mentioned briefly. It is thorough in documenting the processes involved in content moderation at scale, and provides both a primer for readers new to the area and a wealth of details that will be new even to experienced readers. Though comprehensive, this work leaves many areas still open for exploration, particularly in the realm of user-driven moderation and users\u2019 experiences with moderation.

Videogames and videogame development are an important component of this new media landscape as one of the largest grossing industries in North America (Entertainment Software Association 2015). Research related to education and videogames has examined the learning potential of playing digital games. Scholars have explored how game mechanics have a rhetorical influence on players (Bogost 2007) and how \u201cserious\u201d social and political content can be taught/learned through gameplay (Frasca 2001; Dahya 2009). Others have considered the important role of videogames for learning and literacy (Gee 2003; Squire and Jenkins 2003; Squire 2011), the rich social worlds of massively multiplayer online games (Steinkuehler 2004; Nardi 2009; Dickey 2011), and the complexities of identity and representation through interaction with videogames (Shaw 2014; Jenson et al. 2011). These studies (among many others) demonstrate the potential of digital videogames as a valuable component of formal and informal education and support the continued exploration of videogame design and play as an important part of 21st century education (for a range of examples, see Dickey 2007; Kahne, Middaugh, and Evans 2008; Gerber et al. 2014; Fisher and Jenson 2016).

Creating videogames is one way to build multimedia literacy and improve computer-related skills and knowledge. Videogame development involves computational thinking, including the use of algorithms, setting game conditions, attributing specific variables for movement, speed, and action, continual problem solving, and it also includes significant arts-based practices (Kafai et al. 1998; Peppler and Kafai 2007; Carbonaro et al. 2010; Denner 2011; Denner, Werner, and Ortiz 2012; Kafai et al. 2012).

The value that their perspectives bring to the field of oral history is a unique set of one-on-one conversations with students who have selected them from national databases of STEM leaders. Additionally the leaders provide previously unprecedented mentorship and perspectives into their life stories in science. Currently starting its fifth year, the goal of this project is to add to the body of knowledge of oral history by collecting oral histories of women in physics and engineering whose career paths span leadership roles in industry, government, and academia. This project is a collaboration of six female undergraduates at four academic institutions of higher education, IEEE History Center, and American Institute of Physics (AIP) Center for the History of Physics. We are excited that in June 2015 and June 2016, the first three participating students graduated with a STEM degree. Interviews collected in this project are previously published on the IEEE Engineering Technology and History Wiki (ETHW). Following the oral history interviews, the students write reflections to answer the following three research questions (RQ). RQ#1 is \u201cWhat are the key factors that led to the success of the distinguished leaders?.\u201d RQ#2 is \u201cWhat are the crucial skills that enabled their success?.\u201d RQ#3 is \u201cWhat is the impact on my career path?\u201d One objective of this paper is for the participating female students, who are majoring in STEM fields, to present their reflections on the three research questions.

After-school clubs invite children to create games in visual programming environments. The activities emphasize play, while teaching principles of computer science. We explore this phenomenon based on observations and interviews at a code club in Norway, asking whether coding represents an important skill for children and how it is distributed to include all children. We find that coding through play activity is perceived as teaching more than simply the technical skills of programming. Although the fun aspect draws in children and volunteers, parents and instructors describe the code club as being about learning to understand and control the computer, and digital competence required for achieving success in society. The Code Club is described partly as being a \u2018necessity for becoming a good/efficient/empowered citizen in our digital society\u2019, and partly as \u2018children are playing with computers anyway\u2019. These arguments have different consequences for the gender imbalance at the Code Club.

App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to remain as such for the foreseeable future. The research drew on the individual differences theory of gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation has similarly permeated app development. The findings from the exploratory study of 44 app developers in South Africa suggest that gender underrepresentation and bias has spread to app development. The results nonetheless reveal a similar degree of interest among women as men to attempt a career in app development, but more especially, that women have a preference for collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded.

This project provides the students with hands-on STEM research in the government institution and one-on-one exposure to some of the world\u2019s leading female science and engineering pioneers. In this project, participating female undergraduate students pursue leading-edge STEM research. At the same time, the students identify, select, contact, interview, and transcribe a new oral history for the entire career of female distinguished leaders, whose research and career align with the students\u2019 goals. Through this process, the students are simultaneously participating actively as researchers in a government institution, receiving one-on-one mentorship with distinguished female leaders, and preserving a critical part of the historic record (the oral histories) at IEEE. One desired outcome is that the students are motivated by these experiences to graduate with STEM degrees, which thereby increases the retention of women professionals with STEM degrees. A second outcome is that the oral history transcripts of the distinguished female leaders will be archived in perpetuity at the IEEE. Another outcome is to motivate female undergraduate students to complete their STEM degrees, thereby increasing female participation in STEM. To date, students have identified leaders who are CEOs at science and technology companies and members of the National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences. Four full-length, two-hour, oral history interviews have been researched and conducted for these individuals, and three additional interviews are being scheduled. This paper presents key factors in the career development of the distinguished female leaders that led to their success. Common themes that might explain the reasons that the distinguished female leaders have been successful will also be presented. Second, this paper will present first-hand descriptions of the impact on the career outlooks of the participating undergraduates who are conducting all aspects of the project. Participating students are U.S. citizens, which is a desired demographic in the DOD workforce and in addition can help increase the STEM P ge 24962.2 workforce nationally. Training in oral history technique is provided by the IEEE History Center. Oral history is the methodology selected in this project because oral history is a recognized \u201cfield of study and a method of gathering, preserving, and interpreting the voices and memories of people, communities, and participants in past events.\u201d Oral history is the oldest type of historical inquiry, predating the written word, and is also the most modern, initiated with tape recorders in the 1940s and now implemented with 21 century technologies. The IEEE History Center will post the oral history transcripts in perpetuity on the IEEE Global History Network. The project draws on best practices from other oral history projects, such as those collected in 2001-2003 through the \u201cOral History of Women in Computing Project\u201d of Dr. Janet Abbate, who is Associate Professor of Science and Technology in Society, at the Northern Virginia campus of Virginia Tech University. Her work became a major source for her book entitled, \u201cRecoding Gender: Women\u2019s Changing Participation in Computing.\u201d (MIT Press, 2012) and 52 oral histories that are now available on the IEEE Global History Network (http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Women_in_Computing). The transcripts of these interviews are housed by the IEEE History Center on its IEEE Global History Network site (http://www.ieeeghn.org) as part of its broader, important oral history collection which contains over 575 interviews, approximately 55 of whose subjects are female.

Computer technology both reflects and manufactures social values and the reproduction of systems of power in the US. I use ethnographic methods and media analysis to explore the social construction of gender, race and technology and their co-constitution of cultural norms governing labor segregation in CSE. I rely on and contribute to feminist theory from a variety of orientations anthropology, Marxism, science and technology studies and critical race studies to argue theoverrepresentation of white males in CSE is a matter of reproductive and economic justice. My cross-sectional method illuminates barriers women face at three different stages of a CSE career. At the heart of this research are the stories of women who persist in CSE, the barriers to desegregating the field and their ideological justifications and the broad cultural domains that shape and are shaped by the product, practices and applications of computer technology. In my dissertation, I advance five related arguments. First, women who navigate, resist, and subvert male hegemony to persist as workers in CSE have a unique standpoint in US society and have the potential to transform, institutionally and interpersonally, unjust social relations. Second, rites of passage (Davis Floyd 1992) in CSE, for example, interviews, long hours, precision questioning, combative work styles and the valorization of logical and abstract approaches to knowledge production over creative, material ones reproduce the ideological union between masculine ideals and competency in the field. These rituals also serve to indoctrinate CSE workers' to the core values in computing commodity production, including constant observation, intense evaluations of others, and the devaluation of sociality. Third, participants' emotions allowed me to locate and interpret the conflicts and contradictions of women CSE professionals. Many of these contradictions signal a rupture, women's struggle to navigate the bifurcated nature of their workplace role participants privileged to be agents in a powerful field and marginalized members of this field (Smith 1990). These sites of rupture are areas ripe for social change activism. Fourth, the majority of my participants have social change aspirations. They want to use their CSE skills to make the world a better place. These aspirations correlate with a commitment to support other women in CSE. Navigating the experience of rupture, combined with a yearning for social justice, may ignite feminist consciousness in women CSE workers, which can lead to collective action in pursuit not only of equality in CSE but also in broader cultural domains. Finally, I argue that social change aspirations are a collective form of reproductive aspirations and CSE workers can effectively organize around the shared yearning to contribute to the reproduction of the collective well being of society. These findings elucidate the causes of women's underrepresentation in CSE and the consequences of denying women of all ethnicities the opportunity to influence the design and application of technology. My research is meant to inform strategies that eradicate the barriers excluding women from Computer Science and Engineering and transform the powers of technology to advance social justice.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 383, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49146687", "name": "Coleen Carrigan"}]}}]}
