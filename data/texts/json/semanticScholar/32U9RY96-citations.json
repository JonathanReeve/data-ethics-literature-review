However, recent theorizing and evidence has cast doubts on the universal applicability of the echo chamber metaphor, pointing out that communication effects on opinion expression are much more complex than the metaphor suggests. Using the refugee crisis in Germany as a background, the current study challenges four implicit premises of the echo chamber metaphor empirically. The findings show a more complex picture than the metaphor implies: (1) Ignoring other information sources beyond SM may lead to severe misinterpretations; seeming evidence for echo chambers disappears after controlling for news media use. (2) SM reliance does not generally stimulate opinion expression. (3) Attitude extremity moderates the effect of SM reliance, suggesting that people with more extreme views are susceptible to echo chamber effects. (4) Attitude position on the issue-at-hand moderates the effect of SM reliance, which suggests that echo chambers do not completely shield their users from the public discourse.

First, what happens when frames are challenged? Second, how resistant are the opinions that initial frames induce? 1,006 participants completed an online experiment where they were randomly assigned to first view a blog post with either complementary or competitive framing on driverless cars. Participants also viewed a blog post that challenged the stance of the first blog post. Results revealed that complementary frames polarized opinions, while competitive frames neutralized framing effects. Competitive frames induced more resistant opinions than complementary frames did. Attitude and support were susceptible to new, antagonistic information. This study concludes that framing effects are ephemeral and easily challenged by different information. Media coverage of controversial issues from technology trends like driverless cars to political issues like elections are often multi-faceted, showing both complementary and competing frames of such issues. The framing literature has extensively examined how exposure to a single frame can shape attitudes (Cacciatore, Scheufele, & Iyengar, 2016), without considerations for how simultaneous exposure to two or more frames might shape attitudes (e.g., Borah, 2011). Even fewer studies have explored how exposure to different, competing information would alter attitudes (de Vreese, 2012). To realistically reflect the contemporary media environment, it is important to examine the effects of complementary and competing frames on public opinion. According to de Vreese (2012), an important question in framing studies require an answer: what happens when frames are challenged?

Considering the abundance of information online, exposing participants to two emphases frames simultaneously emulates a more realistic situation compared with exposing participants to only one frame. Another major question in framing research pertains to: how durable are framing effects? (Baden & Lecheler, 2012). Although most studies attempt to answer this question by testing how long framing effects persist in a longitudinal sense (e.g., Chong & Druckman, 2012; Lecheler & de Vreese, 2011), this study interprets this question as whether framing effects can persist in the face of different information. To answer this question, this study exposes participants to a second stimulus that presents different information to participants to explore how opinions will change when challenged. Specifically, applying framing theory and cognitive dissonance theory, this study examines framing effects and the durability of these effects caused by the different types of frames on attitudes toward driverless cars and support for driverless cars. Further, as the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) posits that individuals with formed opinions might ignore different information that contradicts their current beliefs, this may make framing effects very durable. Alternatively, individuals might ignore existing beliefs in the face of different information, hence making framing effects ephemeral. This study uses the context of driverless cars in Singapore to examine framing effects. Policymakers and scientists have forecasted that the widespread use of driverless vehicles can reduce traffic accidents by eliminating human error (Miles, 2018) and alleviating traffic congestion (Autonomous Vehicles, 2019). Further, driverless vehicles are more efficient in fuel consumption which helps to protect the environment (Worland, 2016). However, driverless cars may also eliminate delivery jobs and fail to react spontaneously to unexpected events (Miles, 2018). The presence of supportive and opposing arguments for driverless cars makes it a suitable context for framing studies. It is also timely to examine the different strategies to communicate about driverless cars to the Singapore public. From year 2022, three areas in Singapore will be ready to include driverless vehicles as a daily commuting option (Lim, 2017). In 10\u201315 years, the Singapore government expects self-driving technology to be ready for widespread application (Cheah, 2017). Hence, this study will provide insights on the best practices that stakeholders can employ to communicate about driverless cars to the public. Studying both attitude and support allows this study to evaluate the degree to which framing can shape opinions. According to the hierarchy of effects, there are three categories of behavior in increasing levels of involvement (Chen & Yang, 2008). The first category with the lowest level of involvement is the cognitive phase, where individuals gain awareness and knowledge of an issue. The second category with a moderate level of involvement is the affective phase, where individuals decide if they like or dislike a product or an issue. The third category with the highest level of involvement is the conative phase, where individuals have a desire to perform a behavior or to carry out an actual behavior. Attitude and support belong to different phases and indicate different levels of involvement. An attitude is an evaluation of an issue (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) that motivates behavior (Fazio, 1990). Attitudes are either positive or negative (Ajzen, 1991), representing overall like or dislike of an issue. On the other hand, support requires considerations beyond whether individuals like or dislike an issue as support contains behavioral elements (Dreyer, Polis, & Jenkins, 2017). Attitudes are classified under the affective 2 I N T E R N A T I O N A L J O U R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I O N R E S E A R C H D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /ijpor/advance-arti.1093/ijpor/edab001/6134888 by N TU Lrary user on 04 M arch 2021 phase, which represents a moderate level of involvement; support is categorized under the conative phase (Palda, 1966). Overall, support indicates a higher level of involvement than attitudes, as seen by how attitudes are considered a precursor of support (Prayag, Hosany, Nunkoo, & Alders, 2013). Hence, even if framing effects can shape attitudes, these effects might not be strong enough to shift support. Indeed, scholars have called for future studies to delineate attitude and support when examining framing effects (Detenber, Ho, Ong, & Lim, 2018). Nonetheless, some scholars argue that support is a type of attitudinal outcome, as individuals can support an issue without acting on it (e.g., Whitmarsh, 2009). Hence, another objective of this study is to compare whether framing affects attitudes and support differently. Complementary and Competitive Framing Framing refers to selecting some aspects of an issue and making these aspects more salient in society (Entman, 1993). Framing is a communication technique that occurs naturally\u2014when informing the public about an issue, communicators often need to present selected aspects of an issue or highlight certain aspects over others. Frames highlight the essence of an issue (Gamson & Modigliani, 1989) and guide individuals\u2019 orientations and conceptualizations of an issue (Chong & Druckman, 2007). Each frame comprises a frame emphasis and a frame direction. A frame emphasis refers to the aspect of an issue being discussed or highlighted (Detenber et al., 2018). Frame direction refers to the stance toward the issue that the frame adopts. Frame directions can be positive or negative, with positive frame being supportive of an issue and negative frames being antagonistic of an issue. Framing studies that exposed participants to a single frame revealed that positive frames improved attitude and support for an issue, whereas negative frames worsened attitude and support for an issue (Lecheler & de Vreese, 2011). These findings suggest that exposure to a single frame can successfully sway opinion of an issue. However, to reflect reality, framing studies should examine how simultaneous exposure to more than one frame might shape attitude and support (Nisbet, Hart, Myers, & Ellithorpe, 2013), especially in the age of the Internet. Most people turn to online sources as their first and main information source (Ho, Leong, Looi, & Chuah, 2019). Without the space restrictions that used to constrain traditional media sources (Wilding, Fray, Molitorisz, & McKewon, 2018), online sources can simultaneously expose individuals to multiple frames. Unfortunately, relatively few studies have explored how simultaneous exposure to multiple frames shapes attitudes (Borah, 2011; Chong & Druckman, 2007). When there is more than one frame in a single exposure, frames can be either complementary or competing (Wise & Brewer, 2010). Complementary frames have different frame emphases but have the same frame direction. That is, complementary frames involve using two or more aspects of an issue to present only reasons to support or reasons to oppose an issue (Wise & Brewer, 2010). On the other hand, competitive frames can have the same or different frame emphases, but the frames have different frame directions (Wise & Brewer, 2010). Competitive frames present one or more aspects of an issue, and one frame might be positive, whereas the other is negative. When viewing competitive frames, individuals view reasons to both support and oppose an issue. 3 COMPLEMENTARY AND COMPETITIVE FRAMI", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 73, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "15788018", "name": "S.

Journalists cannot help but publish content on Facebook if they want to reach the part of their audience that mainly\u2014or even only\u2014consumes news there. On Facebook, journalists are at the mercy of the algorithm that determines the visibility of their content. Because user engagement is a crucial factor in the algorithm, concerns have been raised that journalists are abandoning their normative quality standards to make the news as attractive as possible to the audience\u2014at the expense of media performance. A softened presentation of the news, particularly in Facebook posts, may help achieve this aim, but research on this subject is lacking. The present study analyses this practice of softening the news in four German media outlets\u2019 ( BILD , FAZ , Der Spiegel , Tagesschau ) political Facebook posts. The results show that the overall level of news softening is low to medium. Furthermore, comparing them to website teasers reveals that news softening is only slightly higher on Facebook (mainly BILD and Der Spiegel ), and that there are no converging trends between quality or public service media and tabloid media.

We analyse how people navigate news on social media, and focus on their perception of the different kinds of news selection involved. The analysis uses a mixed-methods design based on focus group material and survey data from Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Across all four countries, with their different political and media systems, we find (i) that the majority do not understand exactly how the information they receive is filtered by algorithms, but they do not uncritically accept it either, because they are sceptical of all forms of selection \u2012 including that performed by editors and journalists, (ii) that approval for algorithmic selection is stronger amongst younger people, and (iii) that those with a high level of interest in \u2018soft\u2019 news topics (and low interest in \u2018hard\u2019 news topics) are more likely to approve of news algorithmically selected on the basis of what their friends have consumed.

It did not take long for some news providers to make use of these developments and launch services that offered news personalized to the tastes of individual audience members. News personalization had, however, been imagined many decades before the availability of the enabling medium. Just as people had anticipated human flight before the Montgolfier or Wright brothers actually took to the air, the idea that an individual\u2019s informational needs could be met accurately, swiftly, and economically predates computer networking. Writing in 1889, Jules Verne and his son Michel imagined, 1,000 years hence, a system of telephonic journalism whereby subscribers would be free to listen only to news of their own choosing, able to \u201cgive attention to one editor and refuse it to another\u201d (Verne & Verne, 1889). In fact, it took far less than 1,000 years for versions of the Vernes\u2019s fantasy to materialize. News personalization surfaced on Internet dial-up services and proprietary networks a mere century later. An early example was USA Today Sports Center (PR Newswire, 1989), an online subscription service that offered personalized news on teams and players. Since then, the number, sophistication, and reach of personalized news services have increased hugely. These increases have prompted a mixture of reactions, some\u2014in the manner of the Vernes\u2014optimistic about the effects on individuals and society, and others less so. Many forms of media\u2014both offline and online\u2014can be made personal through the choice of outlet and of particular stories within. The advent of new media platforms\u2014such as the World Wide Web and satellite television\u2014increased the breadth and depth of media content and the speed and ease with which consumption choices could be made. However, selecting an outlet and stories therein is not\u2014many would argue\u2014true personalization. Rather, personalization requires outlets to differentiate between consumers in terms of which stories are presented, when, and with what prominence. How this is done, in broad terms, is captured in this definition of news personalization: \u201cA form of user-to-system interactivity that uses a set of technological features to adapt the content, delivery, and arrangement of a communication to individual users\u2019 explicitly registered and/or implicitly determined preferences\u201d (Thurman, 2011). This definition makes an important distinction between explicitly registered and implicitly determined preferences. Explicit personalization relies on individual consumers to make choices about the information they would like to see or, indeed, avoid. Implicit personalization does not require individuals\u2019 explicit input on an ongoing basis, but rather uses data collected, for example on the individual\u2019s browsing history.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 17, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "101151586", "name": "Ludwig Maximilian"}]}}, {"contexts": ["Facebook is still the leading source worldwide, but has become less important in 2017, due to news feed algorithm changes [18, 6] and possibly due to the widely discussed presence of \u2018fake news\u2019 and clickbait on the platform."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "6266c28d8849a9aaafdf16dcea35742671257ea4", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6675076", "MAG": "2914229215", "DBLP": "journals/corr/abs-1901-07290", "ArXiv": "1901.07290", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0220446", "PubMed": "31369596"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6266c28d8849a9aaafdf16dcea35742671257ea4", "title": "The reach of commercially motivated junk news on Facebook", "abstract": "Commercially motivated junk news\u2013i.e. money-driven, highly shareable clickbait with low journalistic production standards\u2013constitutes a vast and largely unexplored news media ecosystem.

In particular, these attributes present unique difficulties for the identification and attribution of campaigns, tracing information flows at scale, and identifying spheres of influence. Complications include the anonymity and competing motivations of online actors, poorly understood platform dynamics, and the sparsity of information regarding message transferal across communication platforms. We propose that the use of social network analysis (SNA) can aid in addressing some of these challenges. We begin by providing a brief explanation of the field and its utility in understanding online communications. We discuss how theories drawn from SNA, which seek to make statistical inferences about relationships and information transfer, can be applied to the information operations domain. Specifically, we will focus on how current research in social influence, information diffusion, and cluster analysis can be immediately applied and identify opportunities for future research. We then demonstrate how these analytic techniques can work in practice, utilizing multiple online communication datasets.

The language of cancer, which is a contentious issue, has also not been explored. \n \nIn response, this thesis makes an original contribution by examining how cancer awareness messages are reported in UK newspapers, and the reasons for this, within a public health context. An interdisciplinary, multiple methods analysis is presented consisting of: 1) a manifest content analysis of the presence of key cancer awareness messages, and the people featured in, 447 national and regional UK newspaper articles, 2) a corpus linguistic analysis of the articles\u2019 language (specifically, word collocation, key words and key semantic domains), 3) a thematic analysis of fourteen semi-structured interviews with journalists and press officers.

People featured tended to be unrepresentative of those most at risk of cancer. Cancer was often framed in terms of negative outcomes and unpleasant treatment. Battle metaphor was prevalent. Interviews suggested that newsworthiness factors and journalism norms are contributors to this, but that scope for change may be limited. \n \nCurrently, UK newspaper reporting of cancer often does not reflect contemporary medical opinion, may skew public perceptions of risk and reinforce cancer fear.

As result, the exposure to our friends\u2019 opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering algorithms that select the opinions shown to each user (i) at random (ii) considering time ordering or (iii) its current opinion. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions\u2019 share and distributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point.

It is often abbreviated to fanfic or even fic and exists in a thoroughly grey legal area between copyright infringement and fair use. Although there were a few cases of cease-and-desist letters sent to fan writers in the 20th century, media corporations now understand it is useless to attempt to prosecute fanfic writers \u2013 for one thing, there are simply too many of us and for another it would be terrible publicity. Although modern fanfic can be reliably dated to the 1960s, it is now primarily an online practice and the fastest growing form of writing in the world. This article uses participant observation and online ethnography to explore how fanfic archives utilize digital affordances. Following Murray, I will argue that a robust understanding of digital read\u2013write platforms needs to account for the social and legal context of digital fiction as well as its technological affordances. While the online platform LiveJournal in some ways channels user creativity towards a more self-evidentially \u2018digital\u2019 text than its successor in the Archive of Our Own (AO3), the Archive encourages greater reader interactivity at the level of archive and sorting. I will demonstrate that in some ways, the AO3 recoups some of the cultural capital and use value of print.

For some, the expected impact is assumed to diversify the number of people who wield and influence political power, while for others the impact concentrates and solidifies power to those who could be considered as political elites. The purpose of this thesis is thus to investigate the underlying assumptions surrounding this debate and to construct a theoretical understanding of how social media can influence political power relations. The research conducted in this area has thus far mainly focused on studying Twitter and not many studies exist that have examined Facebook. Moreover, considerable gaps exist within the Finnish context, and no studies exist there that have explicitly examined what direct political gains social media platforms are able to give to its users. This thesis aims to fill these gaps by adopting a case study strategy on the 2015 parliamentary elections held in Finland by using quantitative techniques to estimate the impact that Facebook has had on the electoral performance of those candidates who have chosen to use it in their campaign. The results of this study show that Facebook is indeed linked with electoral gains, and especially the ability of candidates to acquire Facebook \u2018likes\u2019 is a significant factor that can boost their electoral performance. Furthermore, not all candidates are equal in this, and it is non-incumbent politicians who have gained the most from Facebook during these elections. These results highlight the fact that social media in general and Facebook in particular are important subjects of political study and that they do capture a resource that the candidates can use to impact political outcomes. Moreover, this has implications for the future of the status quo of political competition within Finland and might change how politics and deliberation are conducted in the future.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "119713281", "name": "Aleksi Suuronen"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "e39235d8df6ef562fbabffd6f025dbc506f05fe9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2890472113", "DOI": "10.1080/21670811.2018.1493936"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e39235d8df6ef562fbabffd6f025dbc506f05fe9", "title": "My Friends, Editors, Algorithms, and I", "abstract": "Prompted by the ongoing development of content personalization by social networks and mainstream news brands, and recent debates about balancing algorithmic and editorial selection, this study explores what audiences think about news selection mechanisms and why.

This is very explicit in his encoding/decoding model from 1973. Hall here reserves the term \u201ccirculation\u201d for a delimited process within a broader argument for a circular movement, or a \u201creproduction\u201d of culture through media. In this broader view, however, Hall sees circulation as both technological and hermeneutical processes through which meaning and/or ideology move into and out of discursive form. The encoding/decoding text(s) refer on several occasions to \u201ccurrent affairs\u201d but later applications of this model have somewhat neglected the sphere of journalism. This paper consequently situates Hall\u2019s notions of circulation in relation to new modes of circulating journalism on participatory digital platforms. Given the status of Hall\u2019s model, the overall goal of this re-reading is twofold: seeing Hall through contemporary issues puts into perspective key aspects of Hall\u2019s thinking, while Hall\u2019s framework in turn helps illuminate important characteristics of how journalism is ascribed meaning in a digital landscape. The paper ultimately argues that while Hall\u2019s insistence on seeing the circulation of journalism within a broader circuit of culture is as important as ever, some of his main tenets and assumptions need to be rethought and supplemented in light of newer developments.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 13, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "118503889", "name": "Henrik B\u00f8dker"}]}}]}
