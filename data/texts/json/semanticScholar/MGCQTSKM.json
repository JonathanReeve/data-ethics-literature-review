Successful design and implementation of such environments demand thorough analysis of many parameters. This chapter studies the impact of diversity in learner-learner interactions in collaborative virtual teams through a social and cultural perspective. Social differences include gender, race, class, or age. Cultural differences refer to matters like how an individual\u2019s cognition, values, beliefs, and study behaviors are influenced by culture. Instructors must take into consideration the factors that influence individuals\u2019 diversity, and invent new ways to implement successful collaboration. This is crucial, especially regarding teams scattered on different countries or even continents. Social and cultural differences influence an individual\u2019s performance in a learning environment. Such differences must be adequately studied by both the educational organization and the instructors in such a way that the learning procedure will become a positive experience for all the members involved.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 59, "citationCount": 16, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "40473987", "name": "A.
