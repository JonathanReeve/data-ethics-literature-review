This study aims to first to identify and separate the accessible values of internet of things (IoT)-based business models for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) customer groups. It quantifies the drivers to successfully implement disruptive business models.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData were gathered from 292 customers in Western Europe. The conceptual framework was tested using partial least square structural equation modeling.\n\n\nFindings\nManaging disruptions in the digital age is closely related to the fact that the existing trust in buyer-seller relationships is not enough to accept IoT projects. A company\u2019s digitalization capabilities, satisfaction with the existing relationship and trust in the IoT credibility of the manufacturer drives the perceived value of IoT-based business models in B2B settings. Contrastingly, in B2G settings, money is less important.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nResearch refers to one business field, the data set is of European origin only. Findings indicate that the drivers to engage in IoT-related projects differ significantly between the customer groups and therefore require different marketing management strategies. Saving time today is more important to B2G buyers than saving money.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe disparate nature of B2B and B2G buyers indicates that market segmentation and targeted marketing must be considered before joint-venturing in IoT business models. To joint venture supply chain partners co-creating value in the context of IoT-related business models, relationship management should be focused with buyers on the same footing, as active players and co-developers of a personalized experience in digital service projects.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nDiverging from established studies focusing on the relationship within a network of actors, this study defines disruptive business models and identifies its drivers in B2B and B2G relationships. This study proposes joint venturing with B2B and B2G customers to overcome the perceived risk of these IoT-related business models. Including customers in platforms and networks may lead to the co-creation of value in joint IoT projects.\n", "venue": "Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 94, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "113819282", "name": "Christine Falkenreck"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Ralf Wagner"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["In the USA, privacy can legally be expressed as four things: \u201c(1) invasions into protected spaces, relationships, or decisions; (2) collection of information; (3) use of information; and (4) disclosure of information\u201d [3].", "These effects are so profound that \u201call kinds of human activities and decisions are beginning to be influenced by big data predictions, including dating, shopping, medicine, education, voting, law enforcement, terrorism prevention, and cybersecurity\u201d [3]."], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "35002ccc96dfb65cf762c973e2e6a2edc63a849d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1145/3459104.3459201"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35002ccc96dfb65cf762c973e2e6a2edc63a849d", "title": "An Investigation into the Effectiveness of Big Data in Organizations, the Use of Customer Data, and the Ethical Implications of the Data Economy", "abstract": "This paper is an introduction and guide to big data in the modern world, from the perspective of an information system practitioner.

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users\u2019 privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability.

Especially, the study argues that an under-explored African philosophy of Ubuntu can usefully influence big data practices in ways that address this challenge without undermining its benefits.

One can identify or exhibit solidarity with others through psychological attitudes such as thinking of oneself as part of a \u201cwe\u201d and acting in ways that will more likely improve the quality of life of others. The African relational philosophy of Ubuntu deserves to be given an audience not only for epistemic justice but also because the continued absence of African perspective in the discourse on ethical use of HBD science represents a missed opportunity to enrich ethical thinking about HBD from diverse backgrounds.

This literature has been revelatory but tends to replicate a methodological nationalism that erases global racial hierarchies. We argue that digital economies rely on colonial pathways and in turn serve to replicate a racialized and neocolonial world order. To make this case, we draw on W.E.B. Du Bois' writings on capitalism's historical development through colonization and the global color line. Drawing specifically on The World and Africa as a global historical framework of racism, we develop heuristics that make visible how colonial logics operated historically and continue to this day, thus embedding digital economies in this longer history of capitalism, colonialism, and racism. Applying a Du Boisian framework to the production and propagation of digital technologies shows how the development of such technology not only relies on preexisting racial colonial production pathways and the denial of racially and colonially rooted exploitation but also replicates these global structures further.", "venue": "Political Power and Social Theory", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 119, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "117087556", "name": "Ricarda Hammer"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Tina M.

These so-called \u2018data collaboratives\u2019 are seen as a novel way of leveraging different sources of data and expertise for societal impact. Data collaboratives come with new challenges that might require new governance structures and processes. So far, scant attention has been paid in the literature to data collaborative governance. This study aims to fill that gap. Building upon the collaborative governance and information sharing literature, a framework for Data Collaborative Governance is developed. This framework was tested in a living lab that focused on the public problem of anti-social behavior. Empirical data was collected over a period of one and a half years and analyzed based on an abductive research approach. The findings show that data sharing adds new elements to collaborative governance theory and practice. This study also demonstrates that a living lab is a promising methodology for studying data collaboratives. Finally, it shows that working across boundaries of organizations and sharing data to address complex problems in more collaborative ways has the potential to generate insights for complex public problems.", "venue": "Government Information Quarterly", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3330642", "name": "Erna Ruijer"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "989ebd239795e4fc5e07c7422d365d56debb73b3", "externalIds": {}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/989ebd239795e4fc5e07c7422d365d56debb73b3", "title": "The Politics of Responsibility in Emerging AI Technology and Human Rights", "abstract": "Purpose: The \u201cNarrow\u201d AI technologies and its application to different sectors in the U.S. have brought tremendous advantages to the country and its citizens. This paper attempts to examine the opportunities and risks of AI\u2019s potential application to the military health care sector. Yet, some human rights concerns remain. This paper further argues that the new Biden administration should pursue policies that reinforce a human-centric AI to be more supportive of human rights. Method: This paper employs the politics of responsibility theory to examine the present and future of AI responsible governance in the Biden era. Based on resources from various AI related research by the U.S. government, scholars, and experts, this paper further attempts to examine the opportunities and challenges in the ethical area that will likely be generated by applying AI to the American system of military health care. Results: This paper finds that the application of AI in military health care would likely provide immense opportunities, especially in times of COVID-19. However, there are risks posed by the application of AI in various sectors as well as in military health care. Meanwhile, the new Biden administration\u2019s future policymaking stage should emphasize ways in which AI may remain human-centric to be more supportive of human rights. Conclusion: In incorporating AI into virtually every economic sector and into daily life, the U.S. government, together with all sectors of society, should seek ways to maximize opportunities and minimize the risk of overdependence or unregulated exposure to an intelligence far beyond the human level. The new Biden administration should be at the forefront in promoting responsible AI policymaking to be more supportive of human rights.

Respondents are more sensitive to the interviewer\u2019s age when the respondent\u2013interviewer age difference is wider and the normative age distance in gender attitudes is greater. Older respondents are more sensitive to normative age distance in gender attitudes when responding to the interviewer\u2019s age.

In the platform model, datasets are pooled for remote access and analysis, so novel insights for developing better stratified and/or personalised medicine approaches can be derived from their integration. If the integration of diverse datasets enables development of more accurate risk indicators, prognostic factors, or better treatments and interventions, this obviates the need for the sharing and reuse of data; and a platform-based approach is an appropriate model for facilitating this. Platform-based approaches thus require new thinking about consent. Here we defend an approach to meeting this challenge within the data platform model, grounded in: the notion of \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 for the reuse of data; Waldron\u2019s account of \u2018integrity\u2019 as a heuristic for managing disagreement about the ethical permissibility of the approach; and the element of the social contract that emphasises the importance of public engagement in embedding new norms of research consistent with changing technological realities. While a social contract approach may sound appealing, however, it is incoherent in the context at hand. We defend a way forward guided by that part of the social contract which requires public approval for the proposal and argue that we have moral reasons to endorse a wider presumption of data reuse. However, we show that the relationship in question is not recognisably contractual and that the social contract approach is therefore misleading in this context.

Therefore, efforts to make ethical guidelines to cope with these issues are actively being developed. However, most kinds of ethical guidelines present general ethical principles and take a deductive method of solving individual problems in accordance. The purpose of this study is to propose creating ethical guidelines through an inductive method of deriving ethical principles based on ethical judgements on each individual AI-related cases. Method: At first, most representative cases of AI ethics-related guidelines would be investigated in domestic and international level, with collecting documents and literature review. After that, examine the commonalities and differences between cases as these basic data through comparative research methods. Accordingly, it would be revealed that each case is constituted by a deductive method. Finally, as an alternative to these methods, presenting the merits of establishing ethical principles related to AI through inductive cases and specific examples. Results: Most of the representative AI Code of Ethics that currently exist have the form of suggesting principles and then solving ethical problems by applying the principles to the actual events accordingly. This type of approach corresponds to the method of ethics which based on moral principles. However, complex and unpredictable problems are likely to arise when it comes to AI ethics. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to extract the principles of the AI Code of Ethics by establishing and presenting ethical principles through researching and analyzing various individual events related to AI Ethics using deep learning and Big Data Based AI. Conclusion: The following effects can be achieved by using deep learning techniques and Big Data Based AI that contains Ethical Issues together with sound and desirable Moral Judgement on each case, to derive the principles of the AI code of ethics. First, it is possible to extract and secure Big Data as basic resource of presenting Ethical Directions on various ethical problems arising in connection with the development of AI technology. Second, since the Ethical Principles as AI Code of Ethics are established based on empirical data, the validity of the principles can be secured. On the other hand, the AI Code of Ethics derived through deep learning based on such Big Data is likely to result in multiple tyranny or errors of majority due to certain limitations. So evaluation, verification and correction by Human Ethics Experts are essential to prevent these kinds of fault.

The results suggest that reciprocal big data value creation can be seen as a function of the level of benefit and control afforded to consumers regarding the use of their data.

It does so by first reviewing Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s (1987) principles of rhizomatic structures to define the emergence of assemblages. Secondly, it transposes these principles in conceiving the field of CIE as a meta-assemblage of associated and subordinated sub-assemblages of actors driven by varied disciplinary, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary interests.

Using big data technology, the gathered data were processed and analysed according to the objectives of the study. Topic modelling was used in clustering words from different topics. Clustered words were then used for content analysis in determining the needs of the victims. Word frequency count was also used in determining what words were repeatedly used during the course period. To validate the gathered data online, government documents were requested and concerned government agencies were also interviewed.,Findings of this study argue that housing and relief goods have been the top priorities of the victims. Victims are seeking relief goods, especially when they are in evacuation centres. Also, the lack of legal basis hinders government officials from integrating social media information unto policymaking.,This study only reports Twitter posts containing keywords either, Sendong, SendongPH, Washi or TyphoonWashi. The keywords were determined based on the words that trended after Typhoon Washi struck.,For social media and big data to be adoptable and efficacious, supporting and facilitating conditions are necessary. Structural, technical and financial support, as well as legal framework, should be in place. Maintaining and sustaining positive attitude towards it should be taken care of.,Although many studies have been conducted on the usefulness of social media in times of disaster, many of these focused on the use of social media as medium that can efficiently spread information, and little has been done on how the government can use both social media and big data in collecting and analysing the needs of the victims.

Prior research suggests people who die by suicide often communicate their intent to more than one member of their social network. The ubiquity of social media in modern society means an individual's social network may be larger than ever before, which has contributed to a proliferation of colloquial terms and phrases to describe suicide.\n\n\nAIMS\nThe present study collected and validated suicide-related terms from the U.S. English language in 2018-2019. By validating clinical and lay terms with people on the front lines of suicide prevention, the study provides a necessary foundation for lexical analyses of suicide communication on social media.\n\n\nMETHOD\n98 terms related to suicide were collected from online, academic, and other sources. Mental health professionals and members of the electronic mailing list of the American Association of Suicidology were asked to validate terms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe survey validated common terms used to communicate about suicide.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe lexicon did not capture international phrases.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a midrange theorizing approach to integrate currently disconnected perspectives on technology-enabled service, data-driven business models, data ethics and business ethics to introduce a novel analytical framework centered on data-driven business models as the general metatheoretical unit of analysis. The authors then contextualize the framework using data-intensive insurance services. Findings The resulting midrange theory offers new insights into how using machine learning, AI and big data sets can lead to unethical implications. Centered around 13 ethical challenges, this work outlines how data-driven business models redefine the value network, alter the roles of individual actors as cocreators of value, lead to the emergence of new data-driven value propositions, as well as novel revenue and cost models. Practical implications Future research based on the framework can help guide practitioners to implement and use advanced analytics more effectively and ethically.

However, there is a growing misperception that congeries of data can be easily reconstructed into competitive business insights. Such notions have been encouraged by a plethora of mainstream techno-utopian forecasts.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach This paper investigated such claims and related big data developments, including its \u201csystems-first\u201d and oligopolistic orientations. Due to the paucity of current scholarship on an admittedly pessimistic topic, the paper studied contrarian developments in the industry by relying on secondary data. The study of experts and scholars; industrial trends; and discrepancies and critical gaps in the mainstream data narrative were sourced to prognosticate the likely trajectory of many data giants.\n\n\nFindings A key finding was that the big data industry faces an untenable market bubble worth trillions of dollars. This will have severe consequences for common digital access and social stability worldwide. Evidence presented also suggests that the data industrial complex may undergo a function creep by facilitating a transition from surveillance capitalism to surveillance society.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications Primary data for a study of this nature may take years to materialize. This is a \u201cfirst-pass\u201d study that seeks to illuminate latent dangers facing the big data/AI sector. There is a paucity of scholarly study that even remotely touches on this topic. Therefore, supporting arguments was sourced from contemporary reports and expert study (secondary data).\n\n\nPractical implications As control of data may have geostrategic implications, balkanization of the wired ecosystem may be underway with Russia and China leading the way. Future superpowers may be defined by the way they handle data. The concentration of data in fewer hands may also affect citizen innovation.\n\n\nSocial implications A break-down of the data industrial complex may lead to social mayhem as the monetization of presently free software, blogs and social media platforms may be unfeasible.\n\n\nOriginality/value This topic has hardly been explored due to the novelty of big data, its applications and the daily hype over its potentials.

People analytics are said to allow decision-makers to make evidence-based, bias-free, and objective decisions, and expand workers' opportunities for personal and professional growth. Drawing on a virtue ethics approach, we argue that the use of people analytics in organizations can create a vicious cycle of ethical challenges - algorithmic opacity, datafication, and nudging - which limit people's ability to cultivate their virtue and flourish. We propose that organizations can mitigate these challenges and help workers develop their virtue by reframing people analytics as a fallible companion technology, introducing new organizational roles and practices, and adopting alternative technology design principles.

Consumer privacy concerns, privacy empowerment, and trust are established as strong mediators between corporate/regulatory privacy protection efforts and consumer backlash. The application of fsQCA verified that consumer privacy behaviour can be better explained by different configurations of the same causal antecedents.

The results show that Twitter has been studied from several perspectives using various methodological approaches. The review revealed several limitations, including the paucity of research addressing gender, cultural and geographic differences. Limited use of theory is also observed. Five themes emerged identifying the ways Twitter was used for professional development: 1) academic backchannel, 2) networking, 3) information and resource sharing, 4) keeping updated, 5) public engagement and social commentary.

Efforts informed by big data are saving lives, yielding significant benefits. Uses of big data may also undermine public trust in government and cause other unintended harms. Objectives We aimed to identify concerns and recommendations regarding how to use big data on opioid use in ethical ways. Methods We conducted focus groups and interviews in 2019 with 39 big data stakeholders (gatekeepers, researchers, patient advocates) who had interest in or knowledge of the Public Health Data Warehouse maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Results Concerns regarding big data on opioid use are rooted in potential privacy infringements due to linkage of previously distinct data systems, increased profiling and surveillance capabilities, limitless lifespan, and lack of explicit informed consent. Also problematic is the inability of affected groups to control how big data are used, the potential of big data to increase stigmatization and discrimination of those affected despite data anonymization, and uses that ignore or perpetuate biases. Participants support big data processes that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions. Recommendations for ethical big data governance offer ways to narrow the big data divide (e.g., prioritize health equity, set off-limits topics/methods, recognize blind spots), enact shared data governance (e.g., establish community advisory boards), cultivate public trust and earn social license for big data uses (e.g., institute safeguards and other stewardship responsibilities, engage the public, communicate the greater good), and refocus ethical approaches.

This paper aims to explore consumer perceptions about digital privacy and their subsequent motivations to disclose personal data for insurance purposes.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe study uses an exploratory research approach based on in-depth interviews to generate metathemes to provide an understanding of consumer perceptions about digital privacy and data sharing in the insurance sector.\n\n\nFindings\nConsumers were extrinsically motivated to disclose data by financial reward and convenience; however, subsequent intrinsic motivations may be an influence on the initial motivations. Consumers perceived transactions as \u201cfair\u201d if they received the expected rewards, retained control of the data, and the data was not unilaterally used to their detriment. Concern for privacy was generally low, provided antecedent conditions were met.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs the study uses an exploration for discovery approach, the main limitation of this study is its small sample.

This increases the difficulty of a given task, adding to the existing workload and leading to compromised cognitive performances. The human body expresses the use of cognitive resources through physiological responses when confronted with a plethora of cognitive workload. This temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion. \n \nWe predict that recent developments in physiological sensing will increasingly create user interfaces that are aware of the user\u2019s cognitive capacities, hence able to intervene when high or low states of cognitive workload are detected. In this thesis, we initially focus on determining opportune moments for cognitive assistance. Subsequently, we investigate suitable feedback modalities in a user-centric design process which are desirable for cognitive assistance. We present design requirements for how cognitive augmentation can be achieved using interfaces that sense cognitive workload. \n \nWe then investigate different physiological sensing modalities to enable suitable real-time assessments of cognitive workload. We provide empirical evidence that the human brain is sensitive to fluctuations in cognitive resting states, hence making cognitive effort measurable. Firstly, we show that electroencephalography is a reliable modality to assess the mental workload generated during the user interface operation. Secondly, we use eye tracking to evaluate changes in eye movements and pupil dilation to quantify different workload states. The combination of machine learning and physiological sensing resulted in suitable real-time assessments of cognitive workload. The use of physiological sensing enables us to derive when cognitive augmentation is suitable. \n \nBased on our inquiries, we present applications that regulate cognitive workload in home and work settings. We deployed an assistive system in a field study to investigate the validity of our derived design requirements. Finding that workload is mitigated, we investigated how cognitive workload can be visualized to the user. We present an implementation of a biofeedback visualization that helps to improve the understanding of brain activity. A final study shows how cognitive workload measurements can be used to predict the efficiency of information intake through reading interfaces. Here, we conclude with use cases and applications which benefit from cognitive augmentation. \n \nThis thesis investigates how assistive systems can be designed to implicitly sense and utilize cognitive workload for input and output. To do so, we measure cognitive workload in real-time by collecting behavioral and physiological data from users and analyze this data to support users through assistive systems that adapt their interface according to the currently measured workload. Our overall goal is to extend new and existing context-aware applications by the factor cognitive workload. We envision Workload-Aware Systems and Workload-Aware Interfaces as an extension in the context-aware paradigm. To this end, we conducted eight research inquiries during this thesis to investigate how to design and create workload-aware systems. \n \nFinally, we present our vision of future workload-aware systems and workload-aware interfaces. Due to the scarce availability of open physiological data sets, reference implementations, and methods, previous context-aware systems were limited in their ability to utilize cognitive workload for user interaction. Together with the collected data sets, we expect this thesis to pave the way for methodical and technical tools that integrate workload-awareness as a factor for context-aware systems.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 436, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "40628906", "name": "T.

Building on Becker's hierarchy of credibility, we report on a critical discourse analysis of data ethics codes and emerging conceptualizations of beneficence, or the \"social good\", of data technology. The analysis revealed that ethics codes from corporations and professional associations conflated consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. Interviews with community organizers about social change in the digital era supplement the analysis, surfacing the limits of technical solutions to concerns of marginalized communities. Given evidence that highlights the gulf between the documents and lived experiences, we argue that ethics codes that elevate consumers may simultaneously subordinate the needs of vulnerable populations.

More recently, several wide-area acquisitions have been designed and commissioned by archaeologists, the most extensive of which cover tropical forest environments in the Americas and Southeast Asia. In these regions, the ability of lidar to map microtopographic relief and reveal anthropogenic traces on the Earth\u2019s surface, even beneath dense vegetation, has been welcomed by many as a transformational breakthrough in our field of research. Nevertheless, applications of the method have attracted a measure of criticism and controversy, and the impact and significance of lidar are still debated. Now that wide-area, high-density laser scanning is becoming a standard part of many archaeologists\u2019 toolkits, it is an opportune moment to reflect on its position in contemporary archaeological practice and to move towards a code of ethics that is vital for scientific research. The papers in this Special Collection draw on experiences with using lidar in archaeological research programs, not only to highlight the new insights that derive from it but also to cast a critical eye on past practices and to assess what challenges and opportunities remain for developing codes of ethics. Using examples from a range of countries and environments, contributions revolve around three key themes: data management and access; the role of stakeholders; and public education.

The Chi-square test findings were significant for the following null hypotheses: Internet of Thinking will not bring benefits of the human beings; robots are not needed for industries; big data cannot be used for the business intelligence; artificial intelligence (AI) is not effective; bitcoin transactions should not be allowed; the banking sector is not relatively digitalized; chatbots do not need to be used in banks; drones cannot be used for commercial purpose; robots cannot be used for education purpose; farmers must not learn to yield wirelessly.

Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence.

Algorithms on and beyond the Internet are increasingly influencing, aiding, or replacing human decision-making in many life domains. Their far-reaching, multifaceted economic and social impact, which results from the governancebyalgorithms, is widely acknowledged. However, suitable policy reactions, that is, the gover\u00adnanceofalgorithms, are the subject of controversy in academia, politics, industry, and civ\u00adil society. This governance by and of algorithms is to be understood in the wider context of current technical and societal change, and in connection with other emerging trends. In particular, expanding algorithmizing of life domains is closely interrelated with and de\u00adpendent on growing datafication and big data on the one hand, and rising automation and artificial intelligence in modern, digitized societies on the other. Consequently, the assess\u00adments and debates of these central developmental trends in digitized societies overlap ex\u00adtensively.Research on the governance by and of algorithms is highly interdisciplinary. Communica\u00adtion studies contributes to the formation of so called \u201ccritical algorithms studies\u201d with its wide set of sub-fields and approaches and by applying qualitative and quantitative meth\u00adods. Its contributions focus both on the impact of algorithmic systems on traditional me\u00addia, journalism, and the public sphere, and also cover effect analyses and risk assess\u00adments of algorithmic-selection applications in many domains of everyday life.

However, success is far from guaranteed, and many firms focus too much on technology. Adopting a discovery-oriented, theories-in-use approach, this study examines the strategic organizational shifts that underpin digital servitization. Notwithstanding strong managerial and academic interest, this link between digitalization and servitization is still under-investigated. Depth interviews with senior executives and managers from a global market leader revealed that to achieve digital service-led growth, a firm and its network need to make three interconnected shifts: (1) from planning to discovery, (2) from scarcity to abundance, and (3) from hierarchy to partnership. Organizational identity, dematerialization, and collaboration play a key role in this transformation. For managers, the study identifies a comprehensive set of strategic change initiatives needed to ensure successful digital servitization.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 143, "citationCount": 62, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "20509399", "name": "B.
