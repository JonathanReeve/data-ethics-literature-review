We contribute a mixed methods study analyzing the impact of smartphone use on teachers' work lives in low-income Indian schools. Findings from 70 interviews and 1,361 survey responses suggest that although smartphones aid teaching and administrative functions, smartphone use also significantly predicts burnout among teachers, with technostress providing a major explanation for this relationship. We reveal how teachers' work is constantly surveilled and monitored via technology and how teachers' personal smartphones were controlled and repurposed through socio-technical structures by the higher management to serve management's goals, substantially increasing the work teachers were required to perform outside of work hours. Our work extends technostress research to HCI4D contexts and highlights the need to develop better support structures for teachers and rethink how smartphones are used in their work.", "venue": "Proc.

The designers of these algorithms aimed to promote values such as transparency, equity, and community in the process. However, school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment. In fact, San Francisco Unified School District voted to stop using and completely redesign their student assignment algorithm because it was frustrating for families and it was not promoting educational equity in practice. We analyze this system using a Value Sensitive Design approach and find that one reason values are not met in practice is that the system relies on modeling assumptions about families\u2019 priorities, constraints, and goals that clash with the real world. These assumptions overlook the complex barriers to ideal participation that many families face, particularly because of socioeconomic inequalities. We argue that direct, ongoing engagement with stakeholders is central to aligning algorithmic values with real world conditions.

The article, authored by the journal co-editors and all associate editors, explores the lineage of scholarly undertakings that have contributed to the journal's new scope and mission, which includes past and ongoing scholarship in the following arenas: Digital Youth, Constructionism, Mutually Constitutive Ties in Information and Learning Sciences, and Searching-as-Learning.FindingsThe article offers examples of ways in which the two fields stand to enrich each other towards a greater holistic advancement of scholarship.

However, to date, most prior HCI research examining such interventions has focused on interventions that target students. In this paper, we expand prior literature by examining an intervention, called Meghshala, that targets teachers in low-income schools as its primary users. Through interviews and observations with 39 participants from 12 government schools in India, we show how the introduction of a teacher-focused technology intervention causes teachers to reconfigure their work practices, including lesson preparation, in-classroom teaching practices, bureaucratic work processes, and post-teaching feedback mechanisms. We use the concept of material agency to analyze our findings with respect to teacher agency and reconfiguration, and use theories of teacher knowledge to highlight the kinds of knowledge production that teachers in our research context tend to focus on (e.g., content knowledge).

A key aim of my research was to make a positive contribution to the Siyakhula Living Lab, a large collaborative ICT4D venture between Rhodes University, the University of Fort Hare, industry partners, government and community members. Participatory action research and participatory design provided the methodological foundations for the three cycles of research that took place over three years between 2009 and 2012. The research involved a series of stakeholder interviews, fieldwork, introductory workshops and the design and development of an educational play. Methods used and findings throughout the research journey are detailed, from the first cycle trying to understand the local and project context with the hope of making a positive contribution, through to the final cycle involving the premiere performances of the educational play, Interplay. This thesis advocates the greater use of culturally tailored methods in ICT4D. Research findings support using participatory methodologies and culturally tailored methods to increase the chances of making a positive impact in ICT4D projects and to reduce the risk of harm to participants and their communities. The major contributions of this thesis are methodological. In particular it: 1. Demonstrates the value of conducting stakeholder interviews in an ICT4D project, 2. Demonstrates the role of social relationships in enabling active participation in an ICT4D project, 3.

These practices take into account the quality of work produced by a student in order to hone and improve their skills. The results of this strategy is not always optimal as defining and implementing formative assessment in the classroom is a complex process that must respect the conditions of the classroom. One of the classroom condition that must be taken into consideration is the use of technology. Technology is not neutral and can be better suited to certain task than to others. Understanding the impact of different technologies on specific teaching practices is therefore critically important. The most predominant form of technology within education is currently the Tablet PC. An alternative technology is the Interpersonal Computer (IPC), which allows multiple users located in the same physical space to interact simultaneously.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 239, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2054954757", "name": "V.
