Here Jenkins brings together early twentieth-century texts which treat worries and theories of childhood in America. These snippets are both entertaining and useful for teaching, yet also disturbingly illuminating on perversities in professionalised adult behaviour towards children. The quotation with which I began is taken as a 'source' from a child psychologist, John B. Watson, writing in 1928. Watson's big thing was the 'Threat of Mother Love'. He describes how laboratory experi-ments have demonstrated that stroking, kissing, and cuddling children can produce automatic love responses, and that these produce dependencies which are a bad thing if taken to excess.", "venue": "", "year": 2000, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1963141", "name": "G.
