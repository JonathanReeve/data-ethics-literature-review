Most current automation in the home is packaged in the form of appliances. To better understand the current reality and possible future of living with other types of domestic technology, we went out into the field to conduct need finding interviews among people who have already introduced automation into their homes and kept it there--home automators. We present the lessons learned from these home automators as frameworks and implications for the values that domestic technology should support. In particular, we focus on the satisfaction and meaning that the home automators derived from their projects, especially in connecting to their homes (rather than simply controlling their homes). These results point the way toward other technologies designed for our everyday lives at home.", "venue": "UbiComp", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 83, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1753156", "name": "L.
