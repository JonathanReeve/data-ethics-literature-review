It shows how researchers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds were brought together by a critique of traditional conceptions of technology (for example, \u2018linear models\u2019 of innovation that privileged technological supply or restricted the scope of social inquiry into technology to assessing its \u2018impacts\u2019). Though their analytical frameworks differ to a greater or lesser extent in terminology and approach, some explanatory concepts have emerged, and constitute an effective model of the innovation process. Here, it is suggested, SST offers a deeper understanding and also potentially broadens the technology policy agenda. These claims are assessed through a review of recent research into specific instances of social shaping, particularly in relation to information technology. Finally the article discusses some of the intellectual dilemmas in the field. Though the intellectual cross-fertilisation has been creative, points of tension and divergence between its constituent strands have resulted in some sharp controversies, which reflect upon the theoretical and policy claims of SST.", "venue": "", "year": 1988, "referenceCount": 165, "citationCount": 2290, "influentialCitationCount": 90, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2116648759", "name": "Robin Williams"}, {"authorId": "144179456", "name": "D.
