Banks create \u201cinside money\u201d under a financing through money creation (FMC) model based upon the very process of credit creation and the reputation of the banks that take part in this process.

This chapter will argue that the very creation of a \u201ccryptoasset\u201d will not create an \u201cinside money.\u201d Just as Darling, J. explained in the case Moss v Hancock, these instruments require a quasi-universal level of acceptance within a digital community to be recognized as money. In other words, if we want to create social \u201ccryptoassets\u201d that go beyond the definitions of speculative commodities and securities, we have to build on monetary conventions. To understand this key element, we open this chapter with the analysis of the socio-legal definition of \u201cmoney,\u201d and from this introduction, we are going to highlight the relevance of conventions and network effects to create \u201cinside monies\u201d and \u201coutside monies\u201d within new digital environments.

Drawing on the sociology of money, morals and markets, and valuation studies literatures, I distinguish four factors to explain this: 1) Some formally produced prices as well as market mechanisms shape benchmarks for fees, but the peculiar service psychologists offer (which makes quality judgments hard), the way patients and therapists are matched, and the lack of public information about prices allow for high flexibility in price-setting; these are structural factors that remain unsaid in the conversation on fees. 2) A professional narrative that highlights a responsibility towards patients that should not be contaminated by economic interest. 3) Psychoanalysts\u2019 elaborations on the meanings of the payment, which should reflect the uniqueness of each patient and the bond analyst-patient and symbolize the patient\u2019s commitment to treatment, involving a cost and a loss beyond the economic. 4) The prevalence of cash, face-to-face payment without intermediaries, which helps desacralize the analyst and disentangle the session from the rest of the economic life of the analyst, but impedes evading moralization of the transaction. Payments in psychoanalysis are delicate arrangements, and analysts often stress about valuation and payments. They have to be careful to ensure this flexibility results in morally acceptable transactions.", "venue": "Theory and society", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 130, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39047805", "name": "Daniel Fridman"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "0045c51d1b1a321a7e46ef594eaa94dd804b3da7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3041398900", "DOI": "10.1080/09502386.2020.1788620"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0045c51d1b1a321a7e46ef594eaa94dd804b3da7", "title": "Magical capitalism, gambler subjects: South Korea\u2019s bitcoin investment frenzy", "abstract": "\u2018First, it was just tech people.

Institutional objects depend for their objectivity on the goods produced through those objects, such as economic models, passports or sacred texts.

We identify four value moments through which goods are objectified: institution, the instituting of a good, a belief and an imagination of its objective goodness; production, how the good is produced, what practices are productive of the good; evaluation, how good is the good, the practices and objects through which worth in terms of that good is determined, and territorialization, the domain of reference of the good, to what objects and practices a good can and does refer in its instantiations. We assess the adequacy of our model through an institutional object based on the good of \u201cmarket value\u201d - i.e. an options pricing model.

Since the creation in 2008 of a new cryptographic currency system called Bitcoin, a financial technology market sector of about 250 billion USD has rapidly emerged, raising questions about the nature of currency in society and whether new types of non-national money are warranted and viable. This debate has pitted heterodox economic interests against orthodox economic interests while it has rekindled interest in theories that view money as a social construct with a multitude of potential forms beyond \u2018state\u2019 or fiat money, and in forms that are increasingly predicted to be purely digital in the future. This study seeks to explain the policy, social, and economic factors that underlie perceptions and usage of these new currency types. First, I develop a novel theoretical matrix of trust and control to explain the conditions under which people choose to use any monetary system. Then, I test this theory with a quantitative analysis of policy, trust, socio-economic, and cultural factors affecting the perceptions and usage of the new currency systems of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 28 countries. This analysis draws on usage metrics recorded from the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency network systems, attitudinal data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and European Values Study (EVS), and a proprietary survey of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency perceptions and usage in 15 countries conducted by Ipsos for the behavioral economics research department at ING Group. I performed principal component analyses (PCA) to reduce factors among collected metrics, and I then integrated the findings of the PCA into a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions along three primary vectors: trust, control, and culture. Based on my empirical findings, I group these new currency system users\u2019 personality perspectives into four categories: Evangelists, Pragmatists, Skeptics, and Speculators. The analysis finds Bitcoin and cryptocurrency perceptions and usage are not correlated with the strictness or laxness of public policies concerning Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The analysis also finds Bitcoin interest as measured by Google Search Trends is not correlated to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency perceptions and usage but is correlated to several lower socio-economic metrics related to crime and lack of confidence in law enforcement and government control. There is more favorable perception and usage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in countries with less developed socio-economic profiles, and less favorable perceptions and usage in countries with more developed socio-economic profiles. There is more favorable perception and usage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in countries with aggregate lower generalized trust and lower democratic tendencies, and less favorable perceptions and usage in countries with aggregate higher generalized trust and higher democratic tendencies. Overall, the findings show the extent to which trends in usage and perception of the emergent currencies of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are associated with basic cultural and attitudinal tendencies that are not necessarily related to public policy or other typical monetary theory-based controls. I conclude that a matrix of trust and control is effective at demonstrating how sociological factors explain the landscape of historical, extant, and emergent currency systems and this matrix predicts where Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies situate in society relative to these other currency systems.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 114, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "11024141", "name": "Joseph B.

In this paper, after a short critical review of the sociology of money and the literature on financial literacy, we present and critically discuss the results of the survey. We found that, independently of age, gender, education and income, people know very little about the money system or money institutions and mostly believe in money myths, such as the notion that money is still backed by gold.

The chapter briefly introduces the concept of money found in the writings of Parsons, Marx, Simmel and Weber. The study of money in the social sciences has been affected by the intellectual labour division since then: economists have abandoned all theoretical interest in the nature of money, while the sociologists have turned their attention to the cultural and social conditions that allow money to circulate. The theoretical debate over the nature of money and its social effects was abandoned until the 1980s, when it re-emerged thanks to the research carried out by Viviana Zelizer, Geoffrey Ingham, Nigel Dodd and, more recently, Jens Beckert. The contemporary study of money lacks, a fine-grained explanatory model able to explain the reciprocal influences between money and society. To this end, the chapter introduces the recently developed debate around social mechanisms and analytical sociology and their possible application to the study of money. The sociological explanation of money functioning needs to consider technical characteristics, together with individuals\u2019 characteristics (e.g. values, norms, beliefs and preferences).

Second, the paper\u2019s contribution to the study of financial products and their intertwining with values, affects, and the rhythm of the everyday is that it reveals the role of de-vicing which refers to the strategies conducted by card issuers while dealing with the moral resistance.

The card itself was turned into a device for de-vicing \u2013 destigmatising \u2013 consumer credit. By looking at the technical and cultural arrangements built into the card, I unpack the workings of two de-vicing strategies that reconfigured cards (1) as modern money and (2) as membership/identity cards.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines extensive survey data from rural Bihar with four years of in-depth qualitative data on the supply and demand side of informal lending, we advance a holistic analysis of credit relations in Bihar. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that despite the similarity in borrowing purpose, Scheduled Castes (SCs) are less likely to borrow within their kinship network and are charged a higher interest for smaller principal amounts. Evidence from survey data and qualitative interviews rule out market interlinkages or higher administrative costs of processing smaller loans as likely explanations. To explain the changing role of caste, we take an inter-disciplinary approach and borrow from sociological theories of relational inequalities, treating caste-based differentials in credit market outcomes as a dynamic relational problem between caste categories that are reproduced rather than erased over time. Using qualitative data, we demonstrate how, despite more suppliers trickling into the informal credit landscape, caste remains a defining feature, albeit through different causal mechanisms. SCs do not have access to upper-caste lenders through\u00a0jajmani\u00a0ties or cultural proximity; they also do not have collaterals to offer and rarely benefit from intra-kin lending due to limited SC lenders.

For Peter Birks, unjust enrichment was simply \u2018the law of all events materially identical to mistaken payment\u2019\u2014to be shaped through a process of abstraction from that core case. But this begs the question: how do we work out what counts as \u2018materially identical\u2019 to mistaken payment? The most obvious starting point, and that which Birks chose, is the central characteristic of money: money is valuable. Thus, \u2018the law of all events materially identical to mistaken payments\u2019 is \u2018the law of all events that unjustly enrich one party at another\u2019s expense\u2019. In this article, I argue that this starting point is incorrect. Rather than looking for some factual similarity between mistaken payment and other events, we should identify the role that money plays in justifying restitution. And what justifies restitution in the core case is not the \u2018value\u2019 or \u2018benefit\u2019 that money confers; rather, it is a defect in the legal transaction that links payor with payee. The payee is not liable because she has been \u2018enriched\u2019, but because she is the counterparty to a legal transaction which exhibits traits that there are institutional reasons to disavow.

These hierarchies cannot be subsumed under a single logic, but must be studied as intersecting and mutually constitutive. The second angle concerns the rules of monetary distribution applied by financial professionals, mobilizing, among others, the concepts of investor, market efficiency, risk and value, with their partly contradictory character and their technical, moral and political meanings. These rules are institutionalized in state regulation, labour and commercial contracts, giving the financial industry a certain institutional cohesion worldwide. The last analytic angle then concerns the way in which financial professionals make sense of their place in the global hierarchies they contribute to produce. They tend to use repertoires of meritocracy to connect their role in global monetary distribution to the social elites they tend to belong to, with conflicts that vary across the multiple forms of social identification present in the financial industry worldwide.

Here the Sociology of Money ties in with the problem of the social distribution of knowledge, specifically with the spread of numerical literacy. The historical relationship between money and measures sheds light on the evolution of the roles played by money. In modern economies, as today\u2019s consumers well know, the value relationship is stated in terms of a variable amount of money against a fixed quantity of a commodity. For example, when the cost of gasoline changes, what varies is the price of a fixed quantity of gasoline; so 1. It is important to remember that \u201cvirtual\u201d money is not actually \u201cdematerialized\u201d; plastic, fiber optics, and computer servers and memories are as material as gold, salt, and coacoa (Borisonik, 2018, p. 2). a liter of gasoline that today costs $2 may cost $2.40 six months later. We are familiar with this notion of a variable sum of money for a fixed quantity of a commodity. However, in pre-capitalist economies the value relationship was stated the other way round. That is to say, the quantity of the commodity was variable while the quantity of money was fixed. In this sense, prices were fixed and could not be altered (as part of a medieval conception of the \u201cjust price\u201d); so, when the cost of a commodity rose or fell, what varied was the quantity of the commodity. The most common example was bread. Barring few exceptions, bread prices stayed the same in Europe up until the eighteenth century. Swings in the real price of bread took the form of changing the weight of loaves. When wheat and flour prices rose, loaf sizes shrank. Sometimes a given sum of money (say 5 pence) would buy one an 18-ounce loaf, at other times the same 5 pence only bought a 13-ounce loaf (and the same happened with other products such as butter and cheese). In other words, the prices of some basic commodities were expressed in the quantity of the commodity, not in the quantity of money. As Kula (1986) noted, price as a mechanism that reduces all factors to a common denominator in a given commercial operation is a relatively recent phenomenon. Money actually became the universal commodity equivalent only after the advent of capitalism. Virtual money. Lately, sociologists have begun paying attention to new kinds of money spawned by information technologies. Hitherto, money usually took physical form (salt, shells, beans, gold, and so forth) but it is now becoming \u201cdisembodied\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d, and it moves around the globe in large amounts at great speed (Carruthers and Ariovich, 2010).1 New forms of payment (such as electronic payment systems) and the worldwide use of communication technologies (such as mobile phones) are shaping money in both big financial institutions and in the everyday lives of people in every corner of the world (Vera, 2017). Despite the novelty of these empirical phenomena, the theoretical foundations underlying these recent sociological studies is not so different from the divide between sociologists who see money as a tool of rationalization (now enhanced by new technologies), and those who see money as a culturallyshaped object that is creatively appropriated by common folk in their daily lives (Maurer, 2015). The former predict that the arrival and dissemination of crypto currencies will amplify the rationalizing power of money by its \u201cdematerialization.\u201d On the other hand, since the early developments of virtual currencies, culturally-inclined sociologists have cast doubt on the idea that electronic money would create an entirely impersonal, uniform medium of exchange. Instead, they claim that users and producers of E-money frequently reshape the new methods of payment Money: instrument of quantification, agent of rationalization, cultural object http://digithum.uoc.edu Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Universidad de Antioquia Digithum, No. 24 (July 2019) | ISSN 1575-2275 A scientific e-journal coedited by UOC and UdeA 5 H\u00e9ctor Vera, 2019 FUOC, 2019 A RELATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON CULTURE AND SOCIETY to convey meanings and mark different kinds of social relations (Zelizer, 2011, p. 146-7) One of the Sociology of Money\u2019s premises is that money\u2019s impact not only goes beyond the economy but also that money itself is affected by non-economic factors. Thus money cannot simply be confined to the economic sphere because, like all economic institutions, it is socially embedded. Money as Agent of Rationalization For decades, sociological discussions on money centered on the problems of alienation and rationalization. These topics were prominent for the older generation of economic sociologists. Marx (1972) emphatically linked money with the idea of the alienation and moral perversion of capitalist society. Later Simmel and Weber expanded this topic. For Weber, the concept of rationalization meant that social action is disciplined, systematic, rigorous, and methodical; it also implies areas of social life that are directed by logic, regularity, calculability, and predictability. In his words, \u201ca system of economic activity will be called \u2018formally\u2019 rational according to the degree to which the provision for needs \u2013which is essential to every rational economy\u2013 is capable of being expressed in numerical, calculable terms, and is so expressed\u201d (1978, p. 85). Consequently, a crucial element of rationalization calculability: money, technology, free labor, capital accounting, and double-entry book-keeping are all social practices and institutions that helped the development of rational capitalism (Vera, 2008). Weber was concerned with \u201cthe sociological consequences of money\u201d. In his words, \u201cEverywhere it has been money which was the propagator of calculation\u201d (1978, p. 107). Thus, calculation is key to Weber\u2019s idea of economic rationalization, and calculation needs to be based on quantitative and impersonal systems; numerical terms, he said, are \u201cunambiguously and without a wholly subjective valuation\u201d for economic activities (1978, p. 101). Weber\u2019s contemporaries in Germany were also intrigued by the problem of rationalization in the capitalist world. Sombart wrote a history of what he called the \u201cart of calculation\u201d. For him, calculation meant \u201cthe tendency, the habit, perhaps more \u2013the capacity\u2013 to think of the universe in terms of figures and to transform these figures into well-knit systems of income and expenditure\u201d (1915, p. 125). This calculating habit was closely linked to capitalist expansion and had its roots in the development of commercial arithmetic and accounting in Renaissance Italy. It was there and then, with the incorporation of Arabic numerals, that the first double-entry book-keeping manuals were published and 2. See Le Goff (2004, pp. 34-43, 119-128); Swetz (1987). the first schools were opened to teach merchants the techniques of making financial calculations. Contemporary historians have developed Sombart\u2019s thesis, showing how since the end of the Middle Ages, merchants and bankers involved in large-scale trading needed more than just book-keeping records. They also needed to systematize their knowledge of writing, languages, arithmetic, geography, the use of the abacus, and weights and measures so that they could manage the rising flood of information bearing on their businesses (such as information on the exchange value of currencies, harvests, convoy schedules, etc.). To learn this, non-religious schools were founded; treatises on the most advanced mathematics of the time (which came from India and Islam) were published to explain the use of positional notation and zero; and commerce handbooks \u2013with descriptions of commodities, currencies, weights and measures, itineraries, custom charges, the calendar and so forth. In short, a set of new cultural instruments spread technical and practical knowledge within this social group, which later on became one of the main agents of rationalization in Europe.2 This emphasis on linking rationalization with economic processes (mainly capitalism) was also underlined by Simmel. In The Philosophy of Money, he explored the connection between calculations and money in modern urban life, writing vivid accounts of the impact of modernity on people\u2019s lives (2004, 1971). Among the many memorable metaphors used by Simmel (1971) to describe these phenomena was that of imagining all the clocks in Berlin suddenly going wrong in different ways, disrupting the city\u2019s economic and transport systems. His point was that social relations in a money economy require precise coordination of human activities and thus a stable, standardized time measurement and scheduling framework. According to Simmel \u2013and this was one of his main contributions to the sociological analysis of money\u2013 money not only altered economic exchange but also transformed all spheres of social life (law, democracy, time, etc.). The modern mind has become more and more calculative. In his words, \u201cthe calculative exactness of practical life which has resulted from a money economy corresponds to the ideal of natural science, namely that of transforming the world into an arithmetic problem and of reducing every one of its parts to a mathematical formula. It has been the money economy which has thus filled the daily lives of so many people with weighing, calculating, enumerating, and the reduction of qualitative values to quantitative terms\u201d (1971, p. 327-8). The complexity of modern life, linked to money and the intellectual character of urban relationships, has transformed punctuality, calculability, and exactness in ordinary folk\u2019s daily activities.

Scholars from Knapp to Desan have elaborated token theories of commodity money, wherein both precious and non-precious currencies are treated as the products of social construction.

Exploring the semiotic convergence between gold, Bitcoin and modern paper money, I suggest that the broadly Peircean notion of rhematization in which symbol and indexical signs are (mis)taken for iconic ones is particularly suited to unpack the continuing social salience of commodity theories of money across the gold/paper divide.

The chapter also discusses the nature of the payment system and the role of its various players. Apart from providing an overview of the historical development of money, the chapter also looks at emerging forms of money and the challenges these new forms of money present. For example, most forms of digital forms of money like Bitcoin are private money and not state-regulated.

Drawing from previous studies of the notion of the material constitution, both from materialist and institutionalist types (Marx, Mortati, Poulantzas), the article proposes to look at the development of global constitutional law, in its many instantiations, in terms of its relation with the state. Accounts of the autonomy of global constitutional law are requalified in terms of relative autonomy. More specifically, global constitutional law is conceived as a legal construction functional to the transformation of the contemporary state. From the perspective of the material study of constitutional law, the state is still deemed to be the main unit of analysis, but, at the same time, state-centred accounts based on an exceptionalist understanding of sovereignty are rejected as reductive and, at times, inaccurate.", "venue": "Global Constitutionalism", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47513195", "name": "M.

It investigates how the power relations of debt manifest through scale: the body, the household, the community, the nation state, and the global financial system. This is accomplished by integrating the concepts of Debt Space (Harker, 2017) and social reproduction (Steans and Tepe, 2010) to analyse the empirical material collected from two parallel projects into the practices of debt auditing at the national and household level. In doing so we explore key sites of intersubjective meaning making, where moral norms of indebtedness connect to action and agency. From the analysis of the evidence this article makes two interrelated interventions. Firstly, we contend that debt is a transformative force. We observe the effects of debt\u2019s presence as it changes and reconfigures the social space around it. Secondly, bringing together the national and household analysis makes visible how debt audits are a progenitor of resistance. Debt audits invite people to 'care' about their debt (Montgomerie and Tepe-Belfrage, 2016) and consider debt to be a force causing harm in their households, communities and/or the nation state. With this recognition comes a call to seek freedom from debt and the harm that it is causing. A desire for freedom breeds action against the claims that debt makes. These actions include paying it down, diverting expenditures, defaulting, repudiating, cancelling, or paying it off altogether. Each of these are strategies of resistance to the moral authority of debt simultaneously delegitimizing public and private logics of austerity.", "venue": "Geoforum", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 21, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "116240520", "name": "J.

Our third aim is to elucidate the relationship between pawn loans, which have received almost no attention from feminist or other critical political economists, and the social reproduction of households in England and Pakistan.

There is sufficient consensus among scholars that money is an institution created within the economic system and is in line with other institutions that regulate economic action. However, there are different understandings of what institutions are and how they operate, and these understandings imply differences in terms of monetary enforcement, resilience, responsiveness and stability. This paper discusses the two main approaches that conceptualise institutions as rules and as practices presenting an empirically informed discussion of money as an institution drawing on these insights. It grounds the analysis on the empirical case of Argentina as a monetary laboratory and the plurality of currencies that circulate in its economy. The study argues that while the official currency of Argentina corresponds to the institutions as rules approach, the adoption of the U.S. dollar into a bimonetary economy evolved as equilibrium. In between, the massive community currency systems that rose and declined during the economic meltdown between 1998 and 2002 were a hybrid institution that combined rules and practice.
