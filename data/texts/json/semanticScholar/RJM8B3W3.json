In this paper, we focused on Facebook apps and set out to understand how concerned users are about privacy and how well-informed they are about what personal data apps can access. We found that initially, subjects were generally under-informed about what data apps could access from their profiles. After viewing additional information about these permissions, subjects\u2019 concern about privacy on Facebook increased. Subjects\u2019 understanding of what data apps were able to access increased, although even after receiving explicit information on the topic, many subjects still did not fully understand the extent to which apps could access their data.", "venue": "Future Internet", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 26, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1713898", "name": "J.
