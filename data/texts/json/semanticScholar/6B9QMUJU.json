This method has been demonstrated to improve productivity and the quality of software products. Moreover, a recent survey (hereafter referred to as \"the pair programming survey\") found that programmers were universally more confident in their solutions when programming in pairs as opposed to working alone. Likewise, 96% agreed they enjoy their jobs more when pair programming [12].", "venue": "Commun.
