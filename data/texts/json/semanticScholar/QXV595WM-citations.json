The analysis is theoretically embedded in the model of the discursive-material knot, which is a non-hierarchical articulation of the discursive and the material, and it is contextualized by a reflection on post-digital culture, which allows revalidating the role of the material in zine production and distribution more. The case study combines the analysis of personal interviews and zine content with an ethnography of the production and distribution processes, including zine fairs. This analysis shows how the alternative media discourse, with its focus on particular aesthetics and amateurism, intersects with networks of bodies, spaces, paper and related objects, many different machines and scarce capitals. This allows arguing that the material is omnipresent in zine production and distribution, also in intermaterial and transmaterial ways, but also that zines then use the particularity of this material component to signify their cultural specificity.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6088628", "name": "M.

From an empirical point of view, we put this model to the test through a case study of the cascading data flows that emerged during this public debate. We found three key factors that constituted and shaped this information cascade: 1) the economic structure of the Canadian media market, and especially the concentration of media ownership, which is notably high in the Canadian media ecosystem; 2) data-exchange mechanisms and algorithmic filtering that drive the process of news aggregation, quickly spreading media content without being a significant source of user engagement; 3) grassroots engagement in diasporic media, which activates micro public spheres around nested interests and political standpoints regarding the public issue.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 72, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3387598", "name": "Nathalie Casemajor"}, {"authorId": "39923095", "name": "S.

The echoes of a utopian, perhaps even Marxian, tune can be heard in the positivist accounts of the affordances of such technologies: finally, the means of production have been made available to the masses. And not only the means of production, but also dissemination: one can use a \u201cfree\u201d digital audio workstation (DAW), download a multitude of \u201cfree\u201d plug-ins emulating expensive analogue and digital gear of the past, and upload their song to SoundCloud or a number of different streaming services for consumption by anyone around the globe with an internet connection. However, the overly positivist accounts of the democratization of recording technologies often obscures the anxieties concerning the material conditions and environmentality of these newer technological forms. The digital realm is often (mistakenly) set against the material, a realm of infinite creative and even political possibilities. However, the digital realm is thoroughly material, and inherently dependent on material resources. The explosion in music production made possible through the development of digital technologies disseminated as affordable commodities, has also produced deplorable social and environmental conditions that significantly undermine any utopian narrative.

Logic concentrates attention upon high abstraction, and aesthetics keeps as close to the concrete as the necessities of finite understanding permit. Thus logic and aesthetics are at the two extremes of the dilemma of the finite mentality in its partial penetration of the infinite. (MT 61) Whitehead here asserts that, whereas aesthetics begins from a whole and proceeds to the appreciation of the many details, logic begins from construing individual details whose combination leads to a synthesized whole. Both involve creating a unity through an interplay of the interconnection of many factors. The difference between logic and aesthetics is not of one in opposition to the other. It is rather the intermixing of degrees and manners of selection and attenuation, in which both logic and aesthetics have a role. This is an example of an application of Whitehead\u2019s mereology to identify a whole arising from an interfusion of many interconnected details. He argues that if either side is too dominant\u2014if there is too much emphasis on the whole or to the part\u2014there is a \u2018trivialization\u2019 of experience, in aesthetical or logical experiences. Auxier and Herstein identify the importance of mereology as a mode of thought underlying Whitehead\u2019s approach. Yet their own interpretation is sometimes perhaps not mereological enough. For example, they suggest that some Whitehead scholars are \u2018working with ideas they believe to be Whitehead\u2019s, but are not Whitehead\u2019s ... Putting Whitehead\u2019s name to those ideas can be misleading.\u2019 (Auxier and Herstein 2017, 20, emphasis theirs). I agree that there is a great deal of misinterpretation. It is also the case that Whitehead has more in mind for his project than the correct arrangement and attribution of ideas. Consider a remark of Whitehead\u2019s on why he uses the term \u2018feeling\u2019 to mean a positive prehension.

In Scotland, eradication campaigns tend to be favoured over more pragmatic approaches to management, even though the methods employed can be destructive and long-term success is often limited. In line with recent work critiquing categorical approaches to invasive species management, we argue that such campaigns obscure the underlying conditions of plant invasiveness. We focus in particular on the way perceptual processes shape and are shaped by plant \u201cinvasions\u201d over time. Noting that the majority of plant invasions worldwide are initiated by the horticultural trade, and that visual appearance is a major factor in the selection of plants for trade, we present a framework for critically analysing the visual conditions of horticulturally-led invasion ecologies. Working from the perspective of a more-than-human, materialist media ecology, we cast rhododendrons as entities that modulate light, or photomedia. Our analysis shows how their invasiveness is materially produced as opposed to merely enabled\u2014as a result of the cultural and socioeconomic as well as vegetal relations in which they are entangled. The site of our analysis is an abandoned country estate in Western Scotland that has recently undergone R. ponticum removal.

While social semiotics provides an extensive toolkit for analysing multimodal texts and semiotic practices, the study of social media as semiotic technology poses a significant challenge to existing research methodologies. In this article, we present a social semiotic framework that allows us to describe in analytical details the multimodal meaning potentials offered by digital social media technology and connect these to multimodal text-making and semiotic practices while underscoring the role of technology. Our framework is organized around seven interrelated and inherently informed dimensions: (1) multimodality, (2) practice, (3) the social, (4) medium, (5) the material, (6) the historical, and (7) the critical. This framework could pertain to most types of semiotic technologies, but will here be developed for accounting for social media technologies, and its viability will be illustrated with examples from Instagram. By developing this framework, we aim at elaborating the theoretical basis and analytical tools of social semiotics, and thereby contributing to bringing forward increased understanding of how social media technology enables making, enacting and managing meaning.", "venue": "Social Semiotics", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 104, "citationCount": 14, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "72009801", "name": "S.

Firstly, it unpacks the main notions we bring forth through our title, specifically those of the \u2018encounter\u2019 and the \u2018digital\u2019, as well as the three words we have identified as key to digital theatre practices, namely: deployment, engagement, and trace. The introduction examines how the contributors respond to those ideas, which preceded the articles and documents herein. Secondly, it offers observations that span across and connect the articles and documents, identifying key trends in current critical thinking and creative practice with regard to contemporary theatre in and through the digital. The observations that emerge suggest connections that allow us to reflect more broadly on developments to our understanding of the digital, and indeed to the larger ecosystem of performance in digital culture. The collection consists of five articles and three documents. In her article, Sarah Bay-Cheng offers a stimulating discussion on the circulation of digital imagery within contemporary culture, to address our current obsession with documentation in relation to memory. Bay-Cheng uses Rabih Mrou\u00e9\u2019s work as a case study to argue about the dangers of mistaking the document for the act, and our mediated engagement with the digital image for political action. Andy Lavender studies instances of theatre on and through the Internet to consider the matter of temporality in performance. Addressing a wide range of practices, he asks questions around liveness and presence to argue for a \u2018distributed present\u2019 as an important feature of online performance transactions.

A Critical Approach", "abstract": "Are we facing a process of aestheticisation of the resistances in the digital age? To answer this question, I propose a concept that characterises modes of resistance in specific places and historical times: the Social Form of the Protest (SFP). The SFP is defined by protest tactics, such as demonstrations and barricades, and structural axes of confrontation, such as capital-labour and centre-periphery. Previous resistances to the inequalities generated by modern industrial capitalism were expressed through an equally modern SFP, born as a reaction to its power structures. At present, digital innovation appears to be modifying the parameters of this dialectical relationship. On the one hand, digital social networks increase communicative potential of the contemporary SFP; but on the other they dilute its deep transformation capacity. If confined to the communicative sphere, digital social media filters may turn resistances into media products. In this process the medium and how\u2014through Information and communications technology\u2014are imposed on the content and what\u2014deep transformation objectives. This results in the emergence of the aestheticisation of resistance and limits its ability to resist growing social inequalities.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 18, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2079025468", "name": "A.

A \u2018naturalisation\u2019 of technological material and an alleged disappearance of hardware1 are part of a future imaginary in which progress is measured against digital technology\u2019s minimal material intervention in human practices and environments. Similarly, in popular culture, techno-human relations are often described as issues of materiality. When the first Matrix movie came out in 1999, it evoked a future scenario in which machines control the world, reducing humans to material energy sources (see also Harris/Taylor 2005: Preface). In 2013, Spike Jonze\u2019s science fiction comedydrama Her told a very different story: it described a future in which artificial intelligence programmes become so bored and frustrated with humanity that they simply leave planet earth and all its material conditions behind. These technological developments and imaginaries come along with digital media research which is increasingly concerned with questions of materiality.
