It has a unique peer-production model for organizing cultural knowledge about everyday life in Turkish society. Although online communities were initially theorized as autonomous and libertarian spaces, they have turned into reflections of the societies in which they exist today. This transformation is perhaps best reflected in gender relations within online communities. Toxic masculinity and patriarchal practices commonplace in everyday life not only poison the fabric of online communities but also disrupt the dynamics of peer-produced cultural knowledge. Using the netnographic method, this study examines gender relations in the Eksi Sozluk online community. The most striking aspect of our findings is that some of the male community members persistently abuse Eksi Sozluk\u2019s peer production mechanisms, turning them into a means of harassing female users.

The enforced separation following lockdown motivated people to reconsider how they conducted relationships in and outside the home.

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) was utilised to maintain connections with estranged relationships, as people accessed new platforms to replicate familiar face-to-face (F2F) processes online.

Drawing on posts and comments of Facebook groups created for courses at a university in Hong Kong, together with interviews with students, tutors, and the lecturer, this article examines how code-switching is deployed as a powerful discursive resource in the performance of face-work. Notwithstanding English being the medium of instruction of the courses, code-switching is noticeable. Focusing on these participants' practices, our analysis discovers that code-switching serves primarily to signal the breakdown of the expectedly formal academic participation frame and the switch to an informal frame. Multiple layers of action frames are collaboratively and constantly designed and redesigned in these \u2018social network-educational spaces\u2019 (Chau and Lee, 2017), where the formal-informal, public-private, and academic-social boundaries become indistinct. Closer analysis within and across the spaces further reveals that norms of appropriateness of code-switching to achieve informality and solidarity may vary depending on a combination of individual, contextual, and temporal factors. In addition to contributing to existing literature on code-switching and face-work on Facebook, the article offers practical implications for understanding the increasingly informalized discourses in institutional contexts.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 59, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2061089352", "name": "Dennis Chau"}, {"authorId": "2129453854", "name": "C.

Using the data from a larger research project, I argue that with joint interviews, the process of metacommunication inevitably impacts the couple\u2019s behaviors and direct communication at that moment, and potentially after the interview ends.

Social media has become the official voice of presidents and corporations. Donald Trump, the president of the United States, uses Twitter to address public issues and make policy announcements. Similarly, alternative voices have emerged from social media and evolved into public debates, social movements, and massive mobilizations (e.g., Gerbaudo, 2012; Tufeksi, 2017). The community gathering opportunities of social media (boyd, 2011; Parks, 2010; Chambers, 2013) and the possibilities to generate collective knowledge (Jenkins, 2004) stress the necessity to continue to expand the research in digital spaces. It is important that society and researchers listen to marginalized voices that are seeking empowerment by their use of social media. This thesis seeks to advance this area of research by conducting a discourse analysis of tweets and comments about sexuality, from a community on Twitter that self-identifies as disabled (Disabled Twitter). In this thesis, I conceptualize Disabled Twitter as a counterpublic and argue that their conversations about sexuality are activist and citizenship claims. I analyze tweets from two different readings: a neoliberal and a queer. I pose a neoliberal approach that demands inclusion into our current model, and a queer approach that seeks to reimage a disabled identity apart from the ideas of normalcy. Finally, although these contradictions might seem infructuous, I suggest that these are starting points to reformulate more productive discourses to contest ableist conceptions of bodies and sexualities. While this study only considers two vantage points, these conversations have the potential to be explored from other perspectives. This study is an invitation to expand research at the intersections of disability and sexuality taking place online, and also a call to consider how this participation in digital spaces has the potential to transcend to offline settings.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 319, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2020468237", "name": "Claudia Garcia Mendoza"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": ["\u2026soon after it has been clearly established that the breakup has happened \u2013 although one interview in 2008 involved a story about a man deeply confused about whether the relationship was indeed over because his ex-girlfriend took a few days to change her Facebook relationship status (Gershon 2010a).", "My interviewees increasingly paid attention to the phatic component of communication in part because they found that media-switching generated practices ripe for interpretation (Gershon 2010b)."], "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "9ae2eb0e5477792e657206def6398531b2c0bd28", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3046340819", "DBLP": "journals/tis/Gershon20", "DOI": "10.1080/01972243.2020.1798316"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ae2eb0e5477792e657206def6398531b2c0bd28", "title": "The Breakup 2.1: The ten-year update", "abstract": "Abstract Since 2007\u20132008, American undergraduates\u2019 media ecology has changed dramatically without an accompanying transformation in how they use media to end relationships.

The analysis shows that in both cases, a majority of users share a similar orientation towards a linguistic ideology regarding ordinary conversation as a social institution, as topic-based, as allowing individuals to share and update knowledge so as to enable rapport and intimacy. However, Grindr and Tinder users take almost opposite conversational stances regarding the organization of casual hookups as sexual, one-off encounters with strangers. While many gay Grindr users have to chat to organize quick sexual connections, they become wary of the way their electronic conversations might waylay them into more personal relationships and they try to prevent this by developing an interactional genre made of laconic, fact-checking and very short exchanges. On the other hand, many heterosexual users on Tinder are looking to achieve topically-rich chat conversations. Their interactional dilemma, then, is the achievement of such topically-rich conversation, but with complete strangers.

Moberly This study examines whether online health communications targeting African Americans could be more effective by structuring the message in the format of African American jeremiad rhetoric, a culturally unique version of the American jeremiad literary form. Health disparities (also known as health inequality) persist among African Americans despite increased health knowledge, improved communication practices, and access to health facts online. The problem is systemic, and thus a predictable outcome that requires change in societal structures that produce and maintain inequality. Individual behavior changes to improve health is also necessary. Information alone does not change behavior. Altering environmental factors is also vital to achieving behavior change. Health communications researchers widely accept that culturally appropriate messaging is key to improving health literacy and therefore, positive behavior change leading to changes that improve health outcomes. Language and spirituality are key characteristics of African American culture, though \u201cculture\u201d is complex term, encompassing not only race and ethnicity, but such elements as one\u2019s region, and generational affiliation. Faith can have a positive influence on health outcomes. Historically, African American jeremiad (also known as Afro American jeremiad) rhetoric has been successfully applied to communicate to African American mass audiences, inspiring positive behavior change to advocate for systemic and individual action to confront major national crisis plaguing the group. Applying Bolter and Grusin\u2019s theory of remediation, Ortiz\u2019s theory of neoculturation, and McGuire\u2019s communication/persuasion model, the study concludes by way of an A/B Test experiment that the African American jeremiad form, applied as a linguistic and sociocultural approach to culturally competent online health communications, could potentially inspire positive behavior change that could lead to action toward systemic and personal health changes. The study takes an initial step toward applying this hypothesis to a website of a documentary film project focused on informing and inspiring a movement among African American to overcome health disparities.

Building on insights from anthropological research on the Internet and the use of digital technologies in Indonesia and beyond, this article shows how social media affect the experience and understandings of personal commitment and social engagement that define contemporary Muslim subjectivities. Embedded in the cyberurban space of Bandung, emerging (digital) Islamic socialities offer new orientations and models of sharing the \u2018zeal of piety\u2019 (semangat taqwa) that are appealing and easily adopted by a young generation of pious Muslims.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "118640145", "name": "Dayana Lengauer"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "1a78d1e7b3c10764ada6dc669adc179c9f92f829", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2799624157", "DOI": "10.1111/LASR.12340"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a78d1e7b3c10764ada6dc669adc179c9f92f829", "title": "\u201cThat's How She Talks\u201d: Animating Text Message Evidence in the Sexual Assault Trial", "abstract": "This ethnographic study of criminal sexual assault adjudication shows how prosecutors, defense attorneys, and witnesses animate text message evidence. In contrast to other forms of courtroom testimony, text messages function as multiauthored representations of recorded correspondence in the past. Attorneys and witnesses animate texts authored by or said to characterize persons represented at trial. By whom and how the texts are animated shapes trial processes. Through a detailed comparative case analysis of two Milwaukee, WI, sexual assault trials, this article attends to the process by which text messages are said to personify or characterize authors\u2019 meaning and intent. This animation of electronically transmitted text speaks to credibility and variably emphasizes a witness's place within gendered and racialized cultural norms. Rather than unsettling the trope of \u201che said, she said,\u201d text messages become contested evidence animated by court actors within contexts of longstanding cultural narratives of sexual victimization and offending. Introduction and Background \u201cThere's no video, no injury. It's purely one hundred percent \u2018he said, she said.\u2019 They had a terrible relationship. They were nasty to each other and they don't get along well, probably never will. But there is no evidence to support the state's case, other than their words.\u201d (Defense Attorney in State v. Lee, 2013) An oft invoked trope in cases of sexual violence, \u201che said, she said,\u201d suggests that without third-party eye witness testimony or material evidence, sexual assault allegations rest on conflicting reports provided by victims and alleged perpetrators. Scholars thus argue that questions about witness credibility, particularly of victimwitnesses, are critical sites of legal decision-making \u201cat a number of stages in the handling of sexual assault cases\u201d (Frohmann [ 22] : 213). Developing the concept of intersectionality, legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw ([ 12] : 1244) urged scholars to consider, \u201cthe various ways in which race and gender intersect in shaping structural, political, and representational aspects of violence against women of color.\u201d Courtroom practices constitute one site in which we can consider how structural forces shape the experiences of trial participants, as racializing practices are \u201cin the everyday workings \u2018in [criminal courts]\u2019\u2014in the interaction and social exchanges that define the experience of institutions\u201d (Gonzalez Van Cleve [ 28] : 5). Indeed, jurors\u2019 assessment of witness testimony often does not focus solely on the content of testimony but rather on extralegal factors including complainants\u2019 behavior before the alleged sexual assault (Estrich [ 17] ; Frohmann [ 22] [ 21] ; Konradi [ 36] ; Matoesian [ 37] ; Taslitz [ 48] ) and persuasive cues such as nonverbal behaviors (Chaiken [ 7] ; Ellison and Munro [ 15] ). Sexual assault trial practice is particularly reliant on corroborative evidence and credibility assessments (Corrigan [ 9] , [ 10] ; Frohmann [ 22] [ 21] ), despite feminist legal reforms in the 1980s and 1990s that removed corroborative evidentiary standards from rape statutes (Bevacqua [ 2] ). Electronic technology (e.g., cellular telephones, the Internet, social networking sites) has created new sites for social interaction and communication across a range of social sectors (Horst and Miller [ 33] ), providing new forms of evidence that are able to bring previously private scenes and conversations to life in a court of law. Research suggests that to interpret testimony, including these private scenes and conversations, jurors often consider witnesses\u2019 age, gender, and ethnicity (Brodsky et al. [ 3] ; Bunt [ 5] ; Nagle et al. [ 41] ). This article examines credibility in \u201cthe everyday workings\u201d of criminal courts as they engage with text messaging evidence in sexual assault prosecution. Scholars have revisited evidentiary rules following an influx of instant messaging and posts from social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter introduced as evidence into U.S. courts (Kessler [ 35] ; Uncel [ 49] ). Judges have noted that email and text messages are common forms of evidence (Kessler [ 35] ). Legal scholars argue that the admissibility of text messaging evidence follows the standards of earlier telecommunications (Finkelstein and Storch [ 18] ; Frieden and Murray [ 20] ; Goode [ 29] ; Grant [ 30] ). Federal Rules of Evidence were designed with flexibility in mind so that social media and other digital technologies require admittance under standards that address relevancy, authentication, and probative value (Frieden and Murray [ 20] ; Uncel [ 49] ). Judges treat authentication of digital evidence similarly to other types of evidence, and court challenges are rarely based on reliability or authenticity (e.g., Daubert grounds) but rather on procedural grounds or credibility (Kessler [ 35] ; Van Buskirk and Liu [ 50] ). Beyond the evidentiary issues, however, little sociolegal scholarship has investigated how text messages are animated during adjudicative processes, even as courts are increasingly striving to make sense of text transcripts (Kessler [ 35] ; Uncel [ 49] ). Like any form of evidence introduced at trial, the text messaging transcript has little intrinsic weight (Conley and O'Barr [ 8] ). We argue that it is only when prosecution and defense counsel inventively deploy text messages that it becomes a form of corroborative evidence. Legal scholars reason that focused analysis of the trial reveals how law's unwritten rules are implemented in everyday trial practices (Burns et al. [ 4] ). As a recent and now ubiquitous form of everyday communication, text message transcripts demonstrate how law's unwritten rules function within sexual assault adjudication, drawing upon existing social norms around race, gender, and class. This ethnographic study of criminal sexual assault trials shows how prosecutors, defense attorneys, and witnesses animate written texts to address contested legal facts and witness credibility. In contrast to other forms of witness testimony and material evidence, text messages are interpretable as demonstrations of talk. Namely, text message transcripts consist of messages exchanged between two or more actors (or authors). Animating text messages in trial includes the often strategic enunciating and performance of electronically transmitted text in court in order to personify or characterize both authors\u2019 meaning and intent. These performances speak to questions of witness credibility by representing both the words and characterization of witnesses. Text messages are recorded and preserved communication, distinct from memory recalled on the stand or material documents recorded for official purposes and by institutional personnel (e.g., police records, medical exams, and forensic reports). Court officers introduce text messages authored by adjudicants and witnesses as a form of authentic evidence used to corroborate or dispute particular elements of the \u201che said, she said\u201d story. Text messages are also unique from letters or electronic mail in important ways. In our contemporary social world, the mobile phone represents the immediate capacity to communicate from anywhere via direct contact and turn-by-turn interaction (Katz and Aakhus [ 34] ). Mobile technologies have modified the communication environment, altering the traditional nature of public and private space and relationships. It is the immediate and often intense interaction that is pivotal to understanding text message communication. The dually authored text message transcript is often time-stamped, and the swift nature of communication seems to unfold in short periods, with participants able to send several messages back and forth within seconds. Research demonstrates that the tone and cadence of the transcript is intersubjectively crafted (Gershon [ 25] ). In comparison, letters and emails are most often single-authored and have longer correspondence lags, and do not reflect the coauthored features that text message transcripts exhibit. Cultural narratives remain crucial to understanding trial and legal outcomes as they often rest on the veracity of the victim's narrative (Estrich [ 17] ; Flood [ 19] ). Sexual assault adjudication has long relied on the cultural scaffolding of gender and sexuality (Gavey [ 24] ) including heteronormative, patriarchal, and racialized discourses (Bunt [ 5] ; Estrich [ 17] ; Flood [ 19] ; Frohmann [ 21] ; Gonzalez Van Cleve [ 28] ; Konradi [ 36] ; Matoesian [ 37] ; Taslitz [ 48] ). Depending on these discourses, attorneys provide the legally compelling narratives that convince jurors and judges of the victim's credibility (Schafran [ 45] ; Taslitz [ 48] ). They employ rape myths as \u201cthe culturally pervasive tales of proper intergender sexual behavior that affect the crafting of courtroom and rape narratives at trials\u201d in ways that are likely to resonate with jurors (Taslitz [ 48] : 19). Prosecutors and defense counsel differentially attach rape myths to adjudicants when considering charging and trial decisions (Frohmann 1991, 1997). Weighing the challenges for women witnesses during domestic violence trials, Schafran ([ 45] ) characterized the credibility challenges faced with a tripartite typology that included collective credibility, contextual credibility, and consequential credibility. Collective credibility, as Schafran defined it, rests in belonging to a sector of society that is generally well regarded and trusted. Based on U.S. custom and law, Schafran argued that women, as a group, are collectively mistrusted and are thus compromised in their collective credibility. Schafran ([ 45] : 6) described contextual credibility as \u201cthat [which] depends upon understanding the context of the claim.\u201d Just as research on rape myths and trials show, jurors\u2019 perceptions and decision-making processes are associated with cultural understandings of sexual assault and social norms.

National selfhood took shape as a form of acceptable subjectivity linked to the nation, owing to scalemaking processes that conjoined selfhood and place, not only expanding the scope of place-based identities. Reading national media online and practices like eating traditional foods linked acceptable selfhood to the scale, that is, contingent territorial ordering, of the nation.

Through qualitative, in-depth interviews with recently returned LDS missionaries, this study explores the role Facebook plays in facilitating the maintenance of mission relationships after missionaries have returned home, something interviewees said helps them retain the sense of religious commitment and identity developed through missionary service. Interview findings also complicate the potential benefits of social media use, providing evidence for the argument that returning LDS missionaries are often caught between media technology, personal media preferences, institutional authority, and popular culture.

The essay uses examples from television media and psychology, particularly the concept of verbal overshadowing to emphasize the challenge in reconciling performed and exhibited relations. In doing so, this essay highlights that it is not only individual profiles and contributions that are curated on social media systems, but relationships as well. As a consequence, networked societies cannot contain aspects of human experience such as love which are relational and process-oriented, but only signify these aspects and seek to steer them.

The reason behind the study is to introduce a previously unstudied area into the field of geographically based media studies and hopefully contribute to a deeper understanding of the role played by different means of communication in shaping the dynamics of global friendship. The theoretical approach in this study will be from three different outlooks, migration, polymedia (including the second-level digital divide) and cosmopolitanism. The study is based on data from the Institute for Society, Opinion and Media (SOM) and their survey questionnaire sent out to Swedish expatriates during fall 2014 / winter 2015, also known as Utlands-SOM. The total number of respondents are 2268. The study starts with basic frequencies to find out which media that are the most prominent, then binary logistic regressions have been made. The total number of dependent variables are 21 and these have then been analysed from seven independent variables; age, gender, education, travel patterns, years spent abroad, number of countries lived in and whether or not the respondent consider himself/herself being a cosmopolitan. This generates a total of seven tables (one for each media) with three models in each (contact with friends in current country of residency, contact with friends in Sweden and contact with friends in other parts of the world). Amongst Swedish expatriates, e-mail and Facebook are the two most popular media for keeping in touch with friends, regardless of the friends location. The most significant demographic variable is age. Usage of video call, text message, chat, Facebook and other social media tend to decrease with age. Every year spent abroad decreases the communication with friends in Sweden, but increases the communication in the current country of residency. The number of countries lived in have a positive effect on communication with friends in other parts of the world. Cosmopolitan self-identity is found to be most significant when communicating with friends in other parts of the world, and it also affects e-mail the most. Level of education, which in previous studies have been found closely linked to a cosmopolitan identity, is found to have no significant correlation.

However, recent work suggests that significant digital possessions may complicate moving on; they function as both comforting and painful reminders but currently provide inflexible methods for disposal. A few works have investigated the disposal of digital objects as a means of letting go. To better understand this we interviewed 10 psychotherapists who employ rituals of letting go to help patients overcome loss in situations such as a divorce, a breakup, or a stillbirth. Patients disposed of either natural artifacts or symbolic personal possessions through actions such as burning, burying, or placing in a body of water. Therapists noted that people increasingly have digital possessions, and that the act of deletion does not offer the same cathartic sense of release as disposal of material artifacts. Based on the analysis of this grief therapy, we propose a new conceptual framework for rituals of letting go that highlights temporality, visibility, and force. It provides a vocabulary to talk about disposal. We then offer design implications connecting the rituals of letting go to the disposal of digital things.

This article focuses on the affordances and constraints of different social media platforms as they are perceived by Italian activists. Instead of focusing on single protest movements, or on single platforms, we adopt a media ecological approach and consider a variety of environments where people can choose to express protest-related content. Our main goal is to explore whether, and how, the affordances and constraints of different social media platforms are perceived by users, and how such perceived differences are integrated in everyday social media activities. To this end, we combined in-depth interviews with an adapted version of the cognitive walkthrough and thinking aloud techniques. Respondents reported that they act on social media platforms according to specific representations of what each platform \u2018is\u2019, and how it works. Such perceptions affect users' protest-related social media practices. Although they perceive major social media platforms filtering strategies and are aware, to different extents, of their commodified nature, they report continuing to use them for activism-related communication, often adopting an instrumental approach.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 18, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3101140", "name": "F.

New media environments provide a new context within which young people negotiate their love/sex relationships; however, what is negotiated is often not all that different from what was negotiated before the advent of new media technologies. Using an online discussion board and individual in-person interviews, this paper explores how young Australians, aged 18\u201325 years, engage with dominant gendered discourses to negotiate their love/sex relationships within the context of new media environments. Previous research suggests that young people make use of new media technologies to flirt with one another, to initiate new relationships, to maintain their relationships, and to fight and end their relationships.

Recognising that the official policy of a setting may bear little relationship to the de facto language norms operating within it, this research has also developed from an emphasis on explicit language policies to policies taking more implicit forms (Shohamy 2006; Spolsky 2004), In this regard, it is now generally accepted that policies need to be understood in the context of the language practices of their target audience and their associated language ideologies. Stronger forms of this view go so far as to claim that the \u2018language policy\u2019 of a certain setting can only be understood as the sum total of the policies, practices and ideologies operating within that environment (Spolsky 2004). Within this view, language policy is a dynamic composite of elements, constantly under construction and always subject to change. The expanded view of language policy has also drawn attention to a broader range of language policy agents. When exploring a wider range of domains with attention to both explicit and implicit forms of policymaking, it becomes clear that not simply government officials but also parents, bosses, colleagues, sports coaches, friends, can and do engage in making and modifying language policies. While some theorists claim that doing so requires some kind of actual or perceived authority on the part of the policymaker, e.g. status as a parent (Spolsky 2009), this may not necessarily be the case.

Conversely, detachment has come to symbolize a range of social harms: authoritarianism and hierarchy, being out of touch, bureaucratic coldness and unresponsiveness, a lack of empathy, and passivity and inaction.

Yet we know little about how people themselves understand affordances in their encounters with technology. This article treats vernacular accounts of material structure and practice as clues to the ways that people understand and negotiate technology in their everyday lives. We studied the experiences of romantic partners who use Couple, a relationship app touted as a \u201csocial network of two,\u201d and part of an emerging class of \u201cmicrosocial\u201d platforms. Partners who use Couple have limited knowledge of how others use the app, which offered us a unique lens for witnessing how people make sense of the relationship between practice and material structure. We conducted qualitative interviews with romantic pairs who use Couple, attending to how interviewees conceived of its capabilities, features, and position within larger media ecologies. We argue that affordances simultaneously exist for people at multiple levels of scale, for example: infrastructure, device, app, feature, and so on. These levels are theoretically distinct but can intersect conceptually as people make sense of technological systems and adapt their practices, or create new ones. This approach opens up new ways of understanding the relationship between technologies and practices by drawing attention to how different vernacular frames, such as \u201cchoice\u201d or \u201cconstraint,\u201d reflect particular ways of accounting for material structure.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 55, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1405624034", "name": "Joshua McVeigh-Schultz"}, {"authorId": "2556863", "name": "N.
