The majority of documents encouraged the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods. Thirty-one percent of the guidelines highlighted the importance of minerals and vitamins such as zinc and vitamins\u2009C, A, and D to maintain a well-functioning immune system. Dietary supplementation has not been linked to COVID-19 prevention. However, supplementation with vitamins\u2009C and D, as well as with zinc and selenium, was highlighted as potentially beneficial for individuals with, or at risk of, respiratory viral infections or for those in whom nutrient deficiency is detected.

I show that climate campaigns create leakage effects if coverage of cap-and-trade schemes is incomplete. Campaigns that shift demand away from sectors subject to a cap increase aggregate emissions, as do campaigns to reduce carbon footprints generally if the capped sectors are emission intensive. However, campaigns targeting sectors not covered by a cap-and-trade scheme or propagating retiring of emission allowances reduce emissions.", "venue": "Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 67, "citationCount": 19, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49265031", "name": "Grischa Perino"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "7a76618d127027734386cf41aeeec68dd62d71e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2053181480", "DOI": "10.1353/TECH.2014.0039"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a76618d127027734386cf41aeeec68dd62d71e6", "title": "Of Clunkers and Camaros: Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Programs and the Automobile Enthusiast, 1990\u20132009", "abstract": "This article examines the theory and practice of \u201caccelerated vehicle retirement,\u201d or \u201cscrappage,\u201d programs during the 1990s and 2000s. Scrappage programs, championed by smokestack-industry executives, as well as local, state, and federal authorities, sought to purge the streets of older cars so that their supporters could meet their federal- and state- level air-quality-improvement targets on the cheap. Put another way, these programs aimed to reduce the overall emissions of the nation\u2019s fleet of cars\u2014and, thus, to reduce overall air pollution\u2014by hastening the pace of motor-vehicle obsolescence. Ultimately, vigorous opposition to these programs, especially though not exclusively among antique-and classic-car enthusiasts, led to their abandonment in all but a handful of cases. By examining both the origin and evolution of scrappage programs and the emergence of organized opposition to them, the article contemplates the relationship between the old and the new in the twentieth-century United States.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 109, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "89728325", "name": "David N.
