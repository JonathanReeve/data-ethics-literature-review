Drawing on the tradition of the social construction of technology (SCOT) and 17 qualitative expert interviews I discuss how search engines and their \u201ccapital accumulation cycle\u201d (Fuchs, forthcoming) are negotiated and stabilized in a network of actors and interests, website providers and users first and foremost. I further show how corporate search engines and their capitalist ideology are solidified in a socio-political context characterized by a techno-euphoric climate of innovation and a politics of privatization. This analysis provides a valuable contribution to contemporary search engine critique mainly focusing on search engines\u2019 business models and societal implications.

The fact that Facebook members may well be rich in \u201cvirtual social capital\u201d could be important news from the standpoint of political engagement and mobilization, and, more broadly, in terms of the content and patterns of social interaction. In this article, we discuss the significance of the Facebook phenomenon for scholarship on social networks. A brief introduction to Facebook is presented, along with an assessment of the benefits and limitations inherent in research regarding Facebook networks. We then report some preliminary analyses of small samples from those networks. Drawing on past research regarding face-to-face social relationships, we examine whether online linkages possess some of the central characteristics common in more traditional forms of networks. Specifically, we focus on whether there are signs of clustering by Facebook members according to their political views, and whether the effects of tie strength observed in other forms of networks also are in evidence on Facebook.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 57, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "69959025", "name": "Brian J.

These days, high-level tasks are increasingly being handled by algorithms that can do precise work not only with speed but also with nuance. These bots started with human programming and logic, but now their reach extends beyond what their creators ever expected. In this fascinating, frightening book, Christopher Steiner tells the story of how algorithms took over and shows why the bot revolution is about to spill into every aspect of our lives, often silently, without our knowledge. The May 2010 Flash Crash exposed Wall Street s reliance on trading bots to the tune of a 998-point market drop and $1 trillion in vanished market value. But that was just the beginning. In \"Automate This,\" we meet bots that are driving cars, penning haiku, and writing music mistaken for Bach s. They listen in on our customer service calls and figure out what Iran would do in the event of a nuclear standoff. There are algorithms that can pick out the most cohesive crew of astronauts for a space mission or identify the next Jeremy Lin. Some can even ingest statistics from baseball games and spit out pitch-perfect sports journalism indistinguishable from that produced by humans. The interaction of man and machine can make our lives easier. But what will the world look like when algorithms control our hospitals, our roads, our culture, and our national security? What happens to businesses when we automate judgment and eliminate human instinct? And what role will be left for doctors, lawyers, writers, truck drivers, and many others?Who knows maybe there s a bot learning to do your job this minute.\"", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 104, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "101699746", "name": "Christopher Steiner"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "5ec4d6d86187076cdb95988903c8868fc6ec44b4", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/interactions/Churchill13a", "MAG": "2023297762", "DOI": "10.1145/2504847"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ec4d6d86187076cdb95988903c8868fc6ec44b4", "title": "Putting the person back into personalization", "abstract": "one of the words of our times. I heard it five times yesterday in different conversations. I think I also uttered it once or twice, pushing the count up further. As I reflected on the conversations of the day, it became clear there are many different denotations and connotations of the word personalization. This reminded me of my ruminations on the word social. So, I decided to spend some time researching the concept, trying to understand what personalization means and what happens if you do it. To be a person implies you are an individual, human-like character, an entity with a specific identity, with specific nuances of expression and emotion, and with quirks of character and taste. To personal-ize is to tailor for a specific person. According to the dictionary, if one were to personalize something, one might mark it with initials, a name, or a monogram, as in \" per-sonalizing stationery \" [1]. Or one might \" make something personal, \" specializing a general state of Putting the Person Back into Personalization affairs by adding flavor and nuance that reflect the individual's traits. One might also design or tailor something to meet an individual's specifications, needs, or preferences. Thus, personalization is about individuation and specialization. Arguably, personalization is central to the discipline of human-computer interaction. As my friend Gordon Baxter puts it, \" HCI is about particular people doing particular things in particular contexts. \" Only when we have understood that par-ticularity across a number of cases can we be confident our generalizations and abstractions are truly useful and/or appropriate. This viewpoint exemplifies the case-study approach that is one of the mainstay methods in our practice. In the world of designing Internet applications and services, person-alizing is largely about filtering content to satisfy an individual's particular tastes. In this construction , personalization is a marketing technique, the logical extension of market segmentation. Here, we see the word used more or less synonymously with (and regularly co-occurring with) concepts such as customization, individualization, segmentation, targeting, profiling, one-to-one marketing, and adap-tive services. Influenced by the work of Edward Chamberlain [2] and H.W. Robinson [3] in the 1930s, Wendell Smith in 1956 defined market segmentation as \" viewing a heterogeneous market as a number of smaller homogeneous markets, in response to differing preferences, attributable to the desires of consumers for more precise satisfaction of their varying wants \" [4].

This hostile media phenomenon appears to involve the operation of two separate mechanisms. First, partisans evaluated the fairness of the media's sample of facts and arguments differently: in light of their own divergent views about the objective merits of each side's case and their corresponding views about the nature of unbiased coverage. Second, partisans reported different perceptions and recollections about the program content itself; that is, each group reported more negative references to their side than positive ones, and each predicted that the coverage would sway nonpartisans in a hostile direction. Within both partisan groups, furthermore, greater knowledge of the crisis was associated with stronger perceptions of media bias. Charges of media bias, we concluded, may reflect more than self-serving attempts to secure preferential treatment.

Together, the three features have had an important influence on the ways that new media are understood and used, and have helped shift popular discourses and the study of new media from an emphasis on possibility, novelty, adaptability and openness, toward greater preoccupations with risk, conflict, vulnerability, routinization, stability and control. Given these conditions, the author proposes that three problem areas - again corresponding to practices, tools, and social arrangements - may be important directions for new media studies over the \"next decade in Internet time\". Network literacies and pedagogies must be developed and implemented that prepare individuals to be full and effective participants in society, politics, and culture.

Massive quantities of data on very large social networks are now available from blogs, knowledge-sharing sites, collaborative filtering systems, online gaming, social networking sites, newsgroups, chat rooms, etc. These networks typically number in the tens of thousands to millions of nodes, and often contain substantial quantities of information at the level of individual nodes, sufficient to build models of those individuals.

The Changing Foundations of Political Communication", "abstract": "The great thinkers who influenced the contemporary field of political communication were preoccupied with understanding the political, social, psychological, and economic transformations in modern industrial society. But societies have changed so dramatically since the time of these landmark contributions that one must question the continuing relevance of paradigms drawn from them. To cite but a few examples, people have become increasingly detached from overarching institutions such as public schools, political parties, and civic groups, which at one time provided a shared context for receiving and interpreting messages. What are the implications of this detachment on how people respond to media messages? Information channels have proliferated and simultaneously become more individualized. Is it still relevant to conceive of \u2018\u2018mass media\u2019\u2019 or has that concept been made obsolete by audience fragmentation and isolation from the public sphere? Does this new environment foreshadow a return to a time of minimal effects? If we are looking at a new minimal effects era, how can we distinguish it from the last such period? Retracing some of the intellectual origins of the field may help us identify the fundamental changes in society and communication technologies that are affecting the composition of audiences, the delivery of information, and the experience of politics itself. In particular, we are concerned with the growing disjuncture between the prevailing research strategies and the sociotechnological context of political communication, which may give rise to unproductive battles over findings (Donsbach, 2006). To the extent that research paradigms fail to reflect prevailing social and technological patterns, the validity of results will be in serious question. Consider just one case in point: the famous earlier era of \u2018\u2018minimal effects\u2019\u2019 that emerged from studies done in the 1940s and early 1950s (Klapper, 1960). The underlying context for this scholarship consisted of a premass communication media system and relatively dense memberships in a group-based society networked through political parties, churches, unions, and service organizations (Putnam, 2000).

In its theological formulation this metaphor invariably locates heaven upward, above the earth, accessible not to the body but only to the mind or spirit (with mortification of the flesh [material] one way to achieve spiritual ends), and places hell in the bowels of the earth, down deep in the midst of matter. Material things are heir to all sorts of ills-they break, get dirty, smell, wear out; abstract ideas remain pristine, free from such wordly debilities. The Western conception of history is that it has been characterized by man's increasing understanding and mastery of the physical environment, by the progressive triumph of mind over matter. The evidence of human history seems to confirm our sense that abstract, intellectual, spiritual elements are superior to material and physical things. This has led inevitably to a hierarchical ordering that informs our apprehension and judgment of human activities and experiences.2 This unconscious ordering makes us uncomfortable with the terminological coupling of base material and lofty culture. Nevertheless, the term material culture, if not ideal, has the advantage of being concise, accurate, and in general use. Material The word material in material culture refers to a broad, but not unrestricted, range of objects. It embraces the class of objects known as artifactsobjects made by man or modified by man. It excludes natural objects. Thus, the study of material culture might include a hammer, a plow, a microscope, a house, a painting, a city. It would exclude trees, rocks, fossils, skeletons. Two general observations should be made here. First, natural objects are occasionally encountered in a pattern that indicates human activity-a stone wall or a row of trees in an otherwise random forest, a concentration of chicken bones in a pit or a pile of oyster shells, topiary or a clipped poodle, a tattooed body or a prepared meal. In the broadest sense these natural materials are artifacts-objects modified by man-and are of cultural interest. Second, works of art constitute a large and special category within artifacts because their inevitable aesthetic and occasional ethical or spiritual (iconic) dimensions make them direct and often overt or intentional expressions of cultural belief. The self-consciously expressive character of this material, however, raises problems as well as opportunities; in some ways artifacts that express culture unconsciously are more useful as objective cultural indexes.3 For the moment, however, let it simply be borne in mind that all tangible works of art are part of material culture, but not all the material of material culture is art. The range of objects that fall within the compass of material culture is so broad as to make some system of classification desirable. Sorting by physical materials does not work because of the multiplicity of substances used, even at times in a single artifact. The same is true of methods of fabrication. The most promising mode of classification is by function. The following list is arranged in a sequence of categories that progresses from the more decorative (or aesthetic) to the more utilitarian. 2 For example, poetry, because more abstract, is considered loftier than prose, chess than wrestling, or the practice of law than collecting garbage. In the world of scholarship the more abstract subjects-mathematics, philosophy, literature-are moresubjects-mathematics, philosophy, literature-are more highly regarded than concrete and practical subjects such as engineering. Such ordering takes place even within the material realm of artifacts where all things are not equal. Higher value has been attached to works of art than to utilitarian craft objects since the Renaissance when a distinction was made between the arts, which require intellectual activity and creative imagination in their making, and the crafts, which require greater physical exertion and mechanical ingenuity. Even in a specific art such as painting, there has long been an ordering of genres, ranging from history painting, which springs from the painter's imagination, at the top of the scale, to still-life painting, the replication of worldly objects, at the bottom. In architecture, the mental activity of design has been considered an appropriate pursuit for gentlemen (for example, Thomas Jefferson), while the actual physical labor of building has been carried out by laborers of the lower classes. In sculpture in the nineteenth century, the realization of the form indwelling in the marble was the work of the artist; hacking out replications was the work of stonemasons. 3 See the section on veracity below.", "venue": "Winterthur Portfolio", "year": 1982, "referenceCount": 92, "citationCount": 405, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "104855240", "name": "J.

A: Were used to thinking of the Internet like an enormous library, with services like Google providing a universal map. But thats no longer really the case. Sites from Google and Facebook to Yahoo News and the New York Times are now increasingly personalized based on your web history, they filter information to show you the stuff they think you want to see. That can be very different from what everyone else sees or from what we need to see. Your filter bubble is this unique, personal universe of information created just for you by this array of personalizing filters. Its invisible and its becoming more and more difficult to escape. Q: I like the idea that websites might show me information relevant to my interestsit can be overwhelming how much information is available I already only watch TV shows and listen to radio programs that are known to have my same political leaning. Whats so bad about this? A: Its true: Weve always selected information sources that accord with our own views. But one of the creepy things about the filter bubble is that were not really doing the selecting. When you turn on Fox News or MSNBC, you have a sense of what their editorial sensibility is: Fox isnt going to show many stories that portray Obama in a good light, and MSNBC isnt going to the ones that portray him badly. Personalized filters are a different story: You dont know who they think you are or on what basis theyre showing you what theyre showing. And as a result, you dont really have any sense of whats getting edited out or, in fact, that things are being edited out at all. Q: How does money fit into this picture? A: The rush to build the filter bubble is absolutely driven by commercial interests. Its becoming clearer and clearer that if you want to have lots of people use your website, you need to provide them with personally relevant information, and if you want to make the most money on ads, you need to provide them with relevant ads. This has triggered a personal information gold rush, in which the major companies Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, and the like are competing to create the most comprehensive portrait of each of us to drive personalized products. Theres also a whole behavior market opening up in which every action you take online every mouse click, every form entry can be sold as a commodity. Q: What is the Internet hiding from me? A: As Google engineer Jonathan McPhie explained to me, its different for every person and in fact, even Google doesnt totally know how it plays out on an individual level. At an aggregate level, they can see that people are clicking more. But they cant predict how each individuals information environment is altered. In general, the things that are most likely to get edited out are the things youre least likely to click on. Sometimes, this can be a real service if you never read articles about sports, why should a newspaper put a football story on your front page? But apply the same logic to, say, stories about foreign policy, and a problem starts to emerge. Some things, like homelessness or genocide, arent highly clickable but are highly important. Q: Which companies or Websites are personalizing like this? A: In one form or another, nearly every major website on the Internet is flirting with personalization. But the one that surprises people most is Google. If you and I Google the same thing at the same time, we may get very different results. Google tracks hundreds of signals about each of us what kind of computer were on, what weve searched for in the past, even how long it takes us to decide what to click on and uses it to customize our results. When the result is that our favorite pizza parlor shows up first when we Google pizza, its useful. But when the result is that we only see the information that is aligned with our religious or social or political beliefs, its difficult to maintain perspective. Q: Are any sites being transparent about their personalization? A: Some sites do better than others. Amazon, for example, is often quite transparent about the personalization it does: Were showing you Brave New World because you bought 1984. But its one thing to personalize products and another to personalize whole information flows, like Google and Facebook are doing. And very few users of those services are even marginally aware that this kind of filtering is at work. Q: Does this issue of personalization impact my privacy or jeopardize my identity at all? A: Research psychologists have known for a while that the media you consume shapes your identity. So when the media you consume is also shaped by your identity, you can slip into a weird feedback loop. A lot of people see a simple version of this on Facebook: You idly click on an old classmate, Facebook reads that as a friendship, and pretty soon youre seeing every one of John or Sues posts. Gone awry, personalization can create compulsive media media targeted to appeal to your personal psychological weak spots. You can find yourself eating the equivalent of information junk food instead of having a more balanced information diet. Q: You make it clear that while most Websites user agreements say they wont share our personal information, they also maintain the right to change the rules at any time. Do you foresee sites changing those rules to profit from our online personas? A: They already have. Facebook, for example, is notorious for its bait-and-switch tactics when it comes to privacy. For a long time, what you Liked on Facebook was private, and the site promised to keep it that way. Then, overnight, they made that information public to the world, in order to make it easier for their advertisers to target specific subgroups. Theres an irony in the fact that while Rolex needs to get Tom Cruises permission to put his face on a billboard, it doesnt need to get my permission to advertise my endorsement to my friends on Facebook. We need laws that give people more rights in their personal data. Q: Is there any way to avoid this personalization? What if Im not logged into a site? A: Even if youre not logged into Google, for example, an engineer told me there are 57 signals that the site uses to figure out who you are: whether youre on a Mac or PC or iPad, where youre located when youre Googling, etc. And in the near future, itll be possible to fingerprint unique devices, so that sites can tell which individual computer youre using. Thats why erasing your browser cookies is at best a partial solutionit only partially limits the information available to personalizers. What we really need is for the companies that power the filter bubble to take responsibility for the immense power they now have the power to determine what we see and dont see, what we know and dont know. We need them to make sure we continue to have access to public discourse and a view of the common good. A world based solely on things we Like is a very incomplete world. Im optimistic that they can. Its worth remembering that newspapers werent always informed by a sense of journalistic ethics. They existed for centuries without it. It was only when critics like Walter Lippman began to point out how important they were that the newspapers began to change. And while journalistic ethics arent perfect, because of them we have been better informed over the last century. We need algorithmic ethics to guide us through the next. Q: What are the business leaders at Google and Facebook and Yahoo saying about their responsibilities? A: To be honest, theyre frustratingly coy. They tend to frame the trend in the passive tense: Googles Eric Schmidt recently said It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them, rather than Google is making it very hard Mark Zuckerberg perfectly summed up the tension in personalization when he said A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa. But he refuses to engage with what that means at a societal level especially for the people in Africa. Q: Your background is as a political organizer for the liberal Website MoveOn.org. How does that experience inform your book? A: Ive always believed the Internet could connect us all together and help create a better, more democratic world. Thats what excited me about MoveOn here we were, connecting people directly with each other and with political leaders to create change. But that more democratic society has yet to emerge, and I think its partly because while the Internet is very good at helping groups of people with like interests band together (like MoveOn), its not so hot at introducing people to different people and ideas. Democracy requires discourse and personalization is making that more and more elusive. And that worries me, because we really need the Internet to live up to that connective promise. We need it to help us solve global problems like climate change, terrorism, or natural resource management which by their nature require massive coordination, and great wisdom and ingenuity. These problems cant be solved by a person or two they require whole societies to participate. And that just wont happen if were all isolated in a web of one.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 2, "citationCount": 2397, "influentialCitationCount": 156, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "96905757", "name": "Eli Pariser"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": null, "externalIds": null, "url": null, "title": "Systems and methods for generating dynamic relationship-based content personalized for members of a web-based social network", "abstract": null, "venue": "US 20080040370 A1.", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": null, "citationCount": null, "influentialCitationCount": null, "isOpenAccess": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Bosworth"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "G.
