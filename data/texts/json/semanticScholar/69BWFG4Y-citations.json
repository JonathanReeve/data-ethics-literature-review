I suggest that Indian science fiction that discusses caste with reference to the emerging technoscientific culture can be termed Dalit-futurism. I define this concept by drawing on the tradition of Dalit literature and science fiction and suggest that the Dalit-futurist texts seek to mutate caste to foreground its arbitrary structure. This paper uses the vocabulary of science-fiction criticism to analyze the mutation of caste in the fictional world and draws parallels with our social reality. It suggests that the social divisions in the fictional world echo the Brahmanical patriarchy of the Indian subcontinent. I theorize that the convergence of Dalit-futurism with feminist theory results in a new and transformative feminist configuration termed \u2018Dalit-futurist feminism\u2019. I explicate Dalit-futurist feminism through the cyborg figure, which I suggest shares overlapping themes and concerns with the Dalit feminist standpoint theory, conceptualized by Sharmila Rege and Cyborg feminism conceptualized by Donna Haraway. I suggest that the main protagonists, Aa-Aa and Clone 14/54/G, embody the intersectional, revisionist, and inclusive feminism advocated by Rege and Haraway, arguing for an affiliation-based politics that rejects women\u2019s unity based on essentialized identities like sex, class, race, and caste and uncover the constructive nature of social processes that maintain and reproduce hierarchies, inequalities, and oppression.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2136944341", "name": "Priteegandha Naik"}]}}, {"contexts": ["In Technologies of the Gendered Body: Reading Cyborg Women [2], Anne Balsamo\u2019s study of prosthetics and pacemakers critically examines the gendered production and marketing of these machines, and suggests they figure and promote the \u201cfuture body\u201d as a masculine one.", ", [2, 11, 16, 44, 76, 87]), we explore how power works in human-machine relations and suggest that fuller awareness of the social can enhance technology design."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "031107688e04b1386c865a0ceee6ab9d321f2d9d", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/pacmhci/WagmanP21", "DOI": "10.1145/3449175"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/031107688e04b1386c865a0ceee6ab9d321f2d9d", "title": "Beyond the Command", "abstract": "Machines, from artificially intelligent digital assistants to embodied robots, are becoming more pervasive in everyday life. Drawing on feminist science and technology studies (STS) perspectives, we demonstrate how machine designers are not just crafting neutral objects, but relationships between machines and humans that are entangled in human social issues such as gender and power dynamics. Thus, in order to create a more ethical and just future, the dominant assumptions currently underpinning the design of these human-machine relations must be challenged and reoriented toward relations of justice and inclusivity. This paper contributes the \"social machine\" as a model for technology designers who seek to recognize the importance, diversity and complexity of the social in their work, and to engage with the agential power of machines. In our model, the social machine is imagined as a potentially equitable relationship partner that has agency and as an \"other\" that is distinct from, yet related to, humans, objects, and animals. We critically examine and contrast our model with tendencies in robotics that consider robots as tools, human companions, animals or creatures, and/or slaves. In doing so, we demonstrate ingrained dominant assumptions about human-machine relations and reveal the challenges of radical thinking in the social machine design space.

Marketed as the digital representation of an 18\u201324-year-old, cis-gendered female, Tay.ai was meant to be chatty, personable, friendly, and innocuous. Hours into launch, however, the chatbot\u2019s mimetic programming structure was taken advantage of by organized groups of online social media users, and Tay.ai began replying to queries with alt-right and neo-Nazi ideology. In this article, I explore the role that Tay.ai\u2019s assigned gender and race played in influencing both Tay.ai\u2019s initial design and, subsequently, the program\u2019s monstrous evolution. This is achieved through three avenues of thought. First, I situate Tay within the new public of Web 2.0, a space reliant on user participation and beholden to the neoliberal, racialized, and gendered architectures that produce it. I then consider Tay as an evolution of the chatbot, arguing that Tay is emblematic of both race and gender as social technologies.

However, even before the onset of the current global pandemic (COVID-19), the contemporary \u2018body\u2019 had to be understood as extended beyond physical flesh, through global communications systems. How do our practices on these platforms reveal our evolving relationships with a distributed and digitally mutable body? Drawing on my own construction of cyborg theory as a subset of posthuman discourse, this paper links the practices of explicitly cyborg performance, like Stelarc and ORLAN, with the increasingly banal practice of body-hacking as it is realized in the performance of the self (both consciously and unconsciously) on distributed, social media platforms. These discussions touch both on identified trends in contemporary self-representation as well as artists whose work within those spaces acts as a comment, critique, and application of those practices. Through this discussion, I show how these practices can be understood as body hacking and how that body hacking can both reflect an increasing sense of personal empowerment in relation to the body as well as a morally ambiguous algorithmic redefinition of the paradigmatic body.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47920528", "name": "Minka Stoyanova"}]}}, {"contexts": ["There are longstanding debates on the appropriate way to conceive of the body (e.g., as existing prior to culture or only coming into being through the enactment of cultural meaning) (Balsamo, 1996; Butler, 1990, 1993; Turner, 1984)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "e2f80035961b1ac02ca11d7a06d3c5de5770f7be", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1080/00224499.2021.1925620", "PubMed": "34080946"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2f80035961b1ac02ca11d7a06d3c5de5770f7be", "title": "What are We Forgetting?

The contours of its treatment are dependent on social and political contexts, including concern over women\u2019s sexuality, but it is not clear that existing conceptual frameworks enable expansive examination of the relationship between abortion and sexuality. We conduct a critical interpretive synthesis review of the literature that jointly engages with sexuality and abortion, focusing on the U.S., to highlight the frameworks that authors use to understand the relationship between the two. We find two conceptual frameworks of abortion and sexuality in operation: one that treats the two as discrete, causal variables that operate at the individual level; and another that focuses on how beliefs about what constitutes (in)appropriate sexuality explain ideological positions on abortion. We identify limitations of both frameworks and propose a new conceptual framework \u2013 one that highlights sexual embodiment \u2013 to inspire future research in this area and generate opportunities for knowledge extension.

It utilises digital tools to compile a corpus of Instagram posts that foreground corporeal hybridity, and examines this social media data through the lenses of feminist STS, affect theory and digital studies.

Moreover, close engagement with a final dataset of eighty-nine posts illuminates three particular modes of enacting the cyborg corpus on Instagram: occupation of multiple bodies, awareness of the analogue body and anxious boundary-work.

The findings illuminate how photo-sharing activities are shaped by norms both intrinsic and extrinsic to social media platforms as well as how birth tourists make sense of the complex power dynamics underlying the politics of Asian transnational intimacy. First, they illustrate the racialized, gendered, and classed subjectivities of the informants manifested in the informants\u2019 visualization of the spatiality of birth tourism. The informants primarily took and uploaded photos of leisure settings around the metropolitan area of LA outside of the Chinese-speaking \u2018ethnic enclave\u2019 of the neighborhoods where they stayed. Whereas the co-ethnic spaces are understood as sites for ordinary everyday life, which is not photo worthy, urban localities marked by white, middle-class consumerism are perceived as extraordinary spectacles to be viewed, recorded, and shared. Second, the informants carefully selected the audiences for these consumerism-themed photos on social media. This is because birth tourists are largely constructed by their Taiwanese audiences as upper-class women abusing their reproductive bodies for the transnational exploitation of capital, labor, and loyalty. The careful selection of audiences is also closely linked to a gendered spatial norm regarding reproductive women, which associates pregnant women\u2019s hypermobility and excessive pleasure with irresponsible motherhood.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "117858989", "name": "Tingyu Kang"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "7f731ea2cbd19e6ca08c0e46f2ebc8b8129f2832", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3110977557", "DOI": "10.21659/rupkatha.v12n5.rioc1s26n2"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f731ea2cbd19e6ca08c0e46f2ebc8b8129f2832", "title": "Live (Life) Streaming: Virtual Interaction, Virtual Proximity, and Streaming Everyday Life during the COVID- 19 Pandemic", "abstract": "This paper proposes to examine the digital event of live streaming as an entanglement of digital engagement, virtual proximity, and virtual embodiment as a possible posthuman concern, foregrounded by the ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic The transition witnessed in the medium of communication between humans has significantly deconstructed our understanding of the \u2018normal\u2019, consequently introducing a new phase of lost corporeality, digitally Unforeseen excessive employment of the virtual engagement system of live (life) streaming is a testament to the current human extremity In the light of this transition, the paper attempts to explore the possibility of witnessing some semblance of reality by altering the praxis of normalcy in the practice of the COVID appropriate \u2018new normal\u2019 through the virtual medium of a live stream Since the ontology of human exceptionalism has come under direct attack due to the current pandemic, a reassessment of the human/ technology interphase and its consequent posthuman predicament is urgent Drawing on Rosi Braidotti\u2019s concept of life beyond the self and N Katherine Hayles\u2019s concept of embodied virtuality, this paper analyses the technical feature of live streaming as the \u2018digital\u2019 becoming of human beings in the contemporary COVID- 19 world, further complicating the modes of construction of embodiment through live (life) streaming \u00a9 AesthetixMS 2020 This Open Access article is published under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 4 0 International License (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc/4 0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited For citation use the DOI For commercial re-use, please contact editor@rupkatha com", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 11, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2044956334", "name": "Ujjwal Khobra"}, {"authorId": "2003280508", "name": "R.

While many are sold on Steam, and several have been released on gaming platforms, most visual novels are promoted to enthusiasts or fans of connected properties (primarily anime).

The introduction of queer romances into a framework built for heteronormativity does not itself subvert that heteronormativity. Instead, it might simply enforce the same transactional mechanics and assumptions of queer relationships. The idea of monstrous romance is somewhat undermined by the skinny avatars and anime aesthetic that dominates Monster Prom\u2019s visual experience. However, underneath that superficial resemblance to other dating simulators a more meaningful queering of play exists outside the limitations of the subgenre.

I analyze feminized artificial intelligence (Siri, Alexa, Cortana) in light of two science-fiction narratives: Tomorrow\u2019s Eve, a Victorian novel; and Her, a postmillennial film. Each story exemplifies a pivotal moment in media history: Eve the transition from symbolic to technical media; Her the transition from technical to computational media. Both stories depict a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent, feminized version of the communication media du jour. Whereas Eve and Her operate on our imaginary, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are by our side every day, naturalizing contingent gender divisions. I address three questions: what is the cultural work accomplished by feminized AI? Which boundaries are coming down or built up? What gendered relations are (re)produced? Drawing on media archaeology, critical theory, gender studies, and media theory, this article argues the association of femininity with technology sustains differences across three dimensions: docile labour, replaceable embodiment, and artificial intelligence. This triadic framework weaves together analytic threads that often remain separate to develop a nuanced critique of femininity as a mode for domesticating new technology and technology as materializing gender relations. The discussion extends the framework to a more generalized analysis of AI as a problematic prescription for how we become machine-shaped.

Each of these sciencefiction films was complemented by a musical score that helped to create an onscreen world dominated by a dystopian view of the future. Influenced by the generations of prior science-fiction films, Automata (2014), The Machine (2013), and Ex Machina (2015) are all concerned with the same narrative in which humanity is in decline while artificial robots are rising up and experiencing life in a way that humans are no longer capable of doing. These three films were all chosen as exemplars of recent sciencefiction films with stories about robots versus humans. Further, this difference between robots and humans is paralleled in the film's musical scores. Humans are represented by depressive musical themes with dull and cold timbres that symbolize how empty they have become. Robots, on the other hand, are represented by bright and lively timbres that symbolize how the robots are living more vibrant lives than humans. This thesis traces themes for humans and robots through several important moments and tropes in each film: the state of humanity, the first encounter with the robot, the quality of life for robots and humans, and the eventual conflict that erupts between artificial and organic life. This conflict ends with the arrival of a robotic Eve figure, a sole female robot that is set apart by the film score as a special being, the start of a new age that is dominated by robotic life. These films choose to portray female robots and promote the idea of Eve because the female is seen as a mysterious Other to be feared; in the same way, humans fear these female robots because of their Otherness. Analysis and conclusions were achieved through transcription of the film scores, interviews with the film composers, analysis connecting the score to the visual scene, and constructing a historical context that connects the three films to their predecessors.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 144, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Art"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2055441482", "name": "Rebecca Ann O'Brien"}]}}, {"contexts": ["Balsamo (1995) exploring gendered embodiments in cultural artifacts, argues how a body-technology image does not pre-exist but co-emerges within practices of producing cultural objects."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "375234f113fdd73c84a2f0d8c5fa0f97805784d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2933813627", "DOI": "10.1007/S11858-019-01045-9"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/375234f113fdd73c84a2f0d8c5fa0f97805784d8", "title": "Affective bodying of mathematics, children and difference: choreographing \u2018sad affects\u2019 as affirmative politics in early mathematics teacher education", "abstract": "This paper responds to the frequently occurring phenomena of \u2018sad affects\u2019 experienced by student teachers as they confront the logic of \u2018proper mathematics\u2019 with young children of differently abled bodies.

While the majority of this anthology series\u2019 episodes grapple with disaster arising from the oppressive technology-driven social regimes, a notable exception is Season 3\u2019s Emmy Award-winning episode \u2018San Junipero\u2019. This episode follows two distinct female protagonists who fall in love with each other while experiencing redemptive possibilities of future technologies \u2013 their romance is facilitated by a simulated reality destination for human consciousnesses called San Junipero, accessible only to the elderly and deceased. \u2018San Junipero\u2019 is transgressive in its depiction of a liberating technologised future unconstrained by patriarchal power structures. We argue here \u2018San Junipero\u2019 re-manifests the hopeful, egalitarian vision Donna Haraway explicated in her influential 1984 work \u2018A Cyborg Manifesto\u2019, and that it does so via its hybridisation of codes and conventions of science fiction \u2013 traditionally a masculine genre \u2013 with those of melodrama \u2013 traditionally a \u2018women\u2019s genre\u2019. The cutting edge ideas Haraway elucidated in \u2018A Cyborg Manifesto\u2019 have since been developed within the discourse of cyberfeminism, which analyses illustrations of technologised feminist potentialities in the face of oppressive technologies, as well as critiquing the misogynistic frameworks that could/do underpin technologised social structures. Applying a cyberfeminist lens, we find Black Mirror explores the subjugating possibilities of future technologies \u2013 in its representations of what we term the \u2018tech-symbolic\u2019 \u2013 as well as, in \u2018San Junipero\u2019, the liberating power and potential of technology Haraway predicted. We contend \u2018San Junipero\u2019 offers a unique textual rupturing even within the context of its own series, as it evokes tropes of science fiction as well as melodrama to reconceptualise the masculinist nature of Black Mirror and the science fiction genre more broadly, giving light to a vision of a unified, queer technological future.;", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Art"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2108666934", "name": "Corey Martin"}, {"authorId": "51284652", "name": "J.

This contemporary moment in disability representation provides a compelling space in which to (re-)address the gendered nature of hyper-visible Parasport hybrids, their potential to disrupt \u2018normative\u2019 relations of power, and, the wider impact on disability politics in a neoliberalised culture of widening and affective circuits of bodily inclusion and control.

We analyse these emblematic segments at the intersection of critical disability studies, cultural studies and sport, using concept of ablenationalism to highlight the extent certain technological capacitated parasport bodies perform gendered representational work as part of the seductive apparatus of neoliberal micro-governance suggestive of an emerging ecology of disability-gender relations.

While Laura Backstrom locates the freak show in non-fictional television formats like the talk show and documentary, my paper illustrates how the medical drama, although at times highly self-reflexive, has become another pervasive relocation of the freak show into contemporary television.

While the women in these shows all have 'abnormal' qualities, we consider their portrayal as figurations of monstrosity. In the literature, monstrosity is understood as a way to challenge nonemancipatory norms by offering an alternative identity. Through a content analysis of seven reality TV shows, we identified four types of in/fertile monsters: the cyborg, the freak, the abject, and the childless. We show that these monsters are predominantly non-emancipatory as they all involve mechanisms of altering, excluding, or condemning infertility in relation to what is considered normal and acceptable womanhood.

Women are encouraged to achieve these bodies through practices of self-surveillance, disclosure, and self-advocacy, which are encouraged and normalized through routine use of apps.

Drug-free, known in the field as 'natural', bodybuilding has been developing since the 1970\u2009s as a response to a dominant bodybuilding culture where the use of performance- and image-enhancing drugs has become normalised. Recent years have seen a multiplication of national and international governing bodies, competitions, and participants in drug-free bodybuilding in different parts of the globe. As the field grows, the questions of what constitutes natural bodybuilding and who can authentically represent it become central. Adopting a multi-method, qualitative approach, this article explores the ways organisations and their key figures define and defend their versions of drug-free bodybuilding. The discussion focus is on the policies, meanings and identities embedded in these different versions, and how their production and negotiation makes sense in light of antagonisms between players in the field of natural bodybuilding as well as their relation to drug-enhanced bodybuilding and the wider world of sport. In examining this previously uncharted body culture, the article explores how the use of performance- and image-enhancing drugs provokes responses and processes of contestation and differentiation.

I am thirty-seven, in a tenuretrack job, and pregnant with my first child. What drew me to Vinson\u2019s book was the process of reflecting on my own pregnancy and on my grandmother\u2019s; she, like Vinson, became pregnant at the age of seventeen. When I ask my grandmother what young parenting was like, she often says, \u201cYour mom and I pretty much grew up together.\u201d Although my grandmother dealt at times with unwanted stares and the social shaming that comes with young motherhood, I know that being a teenage mother embroidered together my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s lives in a unique and beautiful way. I also come to Vinson\u2019s book as a feminist rhetorician of health and medicine who studies reproductive and pregnancy rhetorics in online environments. While this is a vibrant and ever-growing area of research, we have yet to give much attention to how teenage mothers enact rhetorical agency. Vinson\u2019s book, then, offers scholars working in feminist and reproductive rhetorics important insights on issues such as visual representations of teenage pregnancy, counternarratives as a means of rhetorical intervention, and social media as tools for everyday public activism. Vinson employs a variety of methods (e.g., rhetorical analysis, interviews, focus groups, storytelling) to argue that young women strategically embody the problem of teenage mothering in ways that \u201cspeak back\u201d to dominant narratives that rhetorically situate teenage motherhood as a national crisis (ix). The core argument of Vinson\u2019s book is that teenage mothers\u2014especially those who are working class and/or mothers of color\u2014are marginalized by social stigmas that label them as high school dropouts, welfare dependents, and poor decision-makers. Vinson argues that young mothers respond to this stigmatization by constructing counternarratives to \u201cengage with and/or counter the dominant discourses of teenage pregnancy and motherhood\u201d (81). To lay the groundwork for this argument, chapter 1 offers historical and contemporary accounts of how national campaigns condemn and dehumanize teenage mothers as social, educational, and economic failures.

Despite this tremendous popularity and influence, the only scholarly writing on any of these creators is a chapter about Liefeld in Bart Beaty and Benjamin Woo\u2019s The Greatest Comic Book of All Time, which partly focuses on this very neglect. It is understandable that a comics studies field still anxious to be taken seriously would reject the excessive and sometimes technically limited styles of these three creators. Yet excess is a meaningful mode of representation in its own right, worthy of serious investigation. Focusing on McFarlane, Lee, and Liefeld\u2019s breakout work for Marvel and taking inspiration from both Beaty and Woo\u2019s work as well as Scott Bukatman\u2019s argument that superheroes represent \u2018a corporeal, rather than a cognitive, mapping of the subject into a cultural system\u2019 (2013, 49), this article will examine how these creators\u2019 excessive superhero bodies reflect tensions underpinning the image-focused culture of the 1990s that was ultimately responsible for their fame and fortune, and with it, a major shift in the balance of power within the American comic book industry. \u2018The Power of the Marvel(ous) Image: Reading Excess in the Artwork of Todd McFarlane, Jim Lee, and Rob Liefeld\u2019", "venue": "Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 80, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Art"], "authors": [{"authorId": "119431682", "name": "Anna F.

Like the grotesque bodies of saints in Christian hagiography, the bodies of Hartman\u2019s half-dragon Saints challenge the boundaries of the modern self, gesturing toward posthumanist intersubjectivity through the ways in which their minds and bodies are linked. However, the series also emphasizes that each half-dragon occupies a different set of intersectional subject positions.

Specifically, I argue that although representations of caucasian whiteness pervade Japanese media and popular culture, they have largely remained racially unmarked, scholarly and popular discourse presenting caucasian whiteness in cultural not racial termes, where it finds expression in notions of an idealized, fetishized, cosmopolitan westernness. As a result, the discourse of whiteness in Japan has largely escaped the kind of sustained critical commentary in Japan and the United States that characterizes the discourse of blackness and other explicitly racially marked Others as well as the literature on whiteness studies, which has yet to fully engage constructions of whiteness outside the (post)colonial experience and the Euro-Americocentric black/white binary. I discuss how representations of whiteness provide a template through which Japanese reflexively construct both the foreign White Other and the \u2018white\u2019 Japanese Self, the evaluation of these selves often being ambiguous and conflicted. I conclude that as Japan\u2019s exposure to whites and non-whites increases and as its own internal diversity becomes more visibly salient, Japanese have begun to contest and more critically interrogate (re)presentations of themselves and to renegotiate their place within given racial and aesthetic hierarchies.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 73, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2069245034", "name": "J.

Discussions revolving around cyborgs seldom include aesthetics, let alone propose aesthetics as an inextricable part of the phenomenon of the cyborg. Rather, the term \u201ccyborg\u201d, a contraction of \u201ccybernetic organism\u201d, evokes a figure of the (hu)manmachine. In the field of social and political sciences, the cyborg is designated a human-machine hybrid, a metaphor of humans becoming machinelike, or a portrait of (political) agency in an era of high technology. These approaches promote a figure of technologized bodies, that is, the cyborg as a figure of technologically dominated and altered bodies. I will sustain that the cyborg contributes to our understanding of agency in the age of high technology. However, in contrast to the general view, I assert that viewing high technology solely as a more efficient version of \u201cmodern technology\u201d is an insufficient position. Rather, contemporary technology should be termed high techn : recent developments indicate the re-emergence of an aesthetic component in the conception of technology. Following this conception, the understanding of the phenomenon of the cyborg is altered. My aim is to bring to the fore the theme of aesthetics in order to portray cyborg(ed) agency without the prejudice of the \u201cmanmachine\u201d. The effort to advocate the value of the cyborg as a prevalent form of agency requires exploring aspects commonly shared in cyborg studies. First, the body is presumed the basis of the cyborg; second, cyborg is considered to consist of contradictory elements; and third, the cyborg is related to the age of high technology and cyberspace. In other words, corporeality, oxymoron, and novelty form the cyborg condition. My investigation of these conditions, carried out by applying both classical philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and Julian Offray de La Mettrie) and contemporary philosophy (Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Michel Foucault) in an updated manner, reveals astonishing requirements. First, the body is in need of a reconceptualization; second, the contradictory elements must be reconsidered; and, third, it is necessary to identify a difference between manmachines and cyborgs. Within this philosophical investigation, undertaken from the entry point of fluctuation between technology and aesthetics, cyborg(ed) agency is portrayed as a phenomenon of the aestheticization of technologized bodies.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 110, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "134458013", "name": "M.

It argues that Hmong teleconference radio offers a rich case study for analyzing mobile phone cultures in a digital era, ultimately showing how women's labor and entrepreneurship within the mobile media realm can be minimized or altogether obscured through gendered hierarchies of value.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39977527", "name": "Lori Kido Lopez"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "da862a316b911c23f634bb38d45062754fedb022", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2795277687"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da862a316b911c23f634bb38d45062754fedb022", "title": "Denatured: Emergent realities of encyclopedic DNA elements", "abstract": "The Human Genome Project was the center of much controversy in the 1990's, as creating a map of the human genome drew into question the boundaries between nature and nurture, or science and society. Fifteen years have now passed since the Human Genome Project's completion, and the new paradigm of genetics is no longer governed by a strict nature/ nurture dualism. This project looks at one of the Human Genome Project's successors: the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which has created new boundaries and limitations in this new phase of genetic thinking. Using a frame analysis and Actor-Network Theory approach to follow how ENCODE has formed and reformed over the years, this project traces the ENCODE project as a new way of translating genetic code from the cell to the world around it, and ultimately back into the cell. Throughout these processes, the ENCODE project brings into question the meaning of human, creates a platform for viewing the genome as a moldable substance, and ultimately presents itself as the end of human disease. \u2029", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 139, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "89978713", "name": "A.
