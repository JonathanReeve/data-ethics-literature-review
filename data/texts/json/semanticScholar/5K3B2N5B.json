Much empirical work observes inconsistencies in judicial behavior. By predicting judicial decisions\u2014with more or less accuracy depending on judicial attributes or case characteristics\u2014machine learning offers an approach to detecting when judges most likely to allow extra legal biases to influence their decision making. In particular, low predictive accuracy may identify cases of judicial \u201cindifference,\u201d where case characteristics (interacting with judicial attributes) do no strongly dispose a judge in favor of one or another outcome. In such cases, biases may hold greater sway, implicating the fairness of the legal system.", "venue": "Law as Data", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 14, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5599390", "name": "Daniel L.
