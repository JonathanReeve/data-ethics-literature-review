These values and ethics may be interpreted and applied in a variety of ways and through a variety of institutions. The library and information science (LIS) community has perhaps not been as responsive as it might be to these issues. LIS educators should first seek to identify the scope of the issues and then help students engage in what may become one of the more controversial domains of our time.", "venue": "", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 39, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144550612", "name": "W.
