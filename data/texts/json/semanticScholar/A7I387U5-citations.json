Predictive policing, cameras, social media and affective assessment", "abstract": "Christian Sandvig and his colleagues (2016) helped to set the research agenda for communication and information scholars concerned about the impact of algorithmic techniques for the generation of strategic intelligence for corporate and government decision-makers. Much of the research that followed was focused on the nature and extent of the biases and errors that emerged when assessments and recommendations affected the life chances of racial and ethnic minority population segments (Barocas & Selbst, 2016). Attention to the impact of these systems has just begun to be developed with regard to the challenges associated with the law, and its defense of the fundamental rights of members of those groups. This paper examines those concerns as they apply to the use of algorithmic systems by urban police, judges, and other central actors within the criminal justice system (CJS) in the United States (Kroll, et al., 2017; van Brakel & De Hert, 2011; Whittaker, et al., 2018; Winston, 2018). Although the use of cameras for the surveillance of target areas within urban centers has been the subject of critical assessment almost from the beginning of their use, much of that work was focused on the behavior of the human monitors that determined what the central focus of those cameras would be, as well as the nature of the behaviors that would trigger the movement of officers to the scene (McPhail, B. and A. Clement, et al., 2013). Increasingly, however, the work of human monitors has been re-assigned to semi-autonomous computer systems, guided by artificial intelligence resources, updated routinely through the use of machine learning techniques (Berman, 2018; Mateescu, et al., 2015; Sackler and Sackler, 2017). The use of cameras, especially those by officers on foot patrol, or in motor vehicles is described, but a primary focus of this paper is on the computer-aided analysis of the images captured by these devices. The capture and use of images from mobile cameras, the analysis of social networks as well as affective assessments of individuals and members of groups derived from automated analysis of social media text and images, as well as other transaction-generated information (TGI) that has come to be referred to as \u201cbig data,\u201d has been recognized as contributing to the development of a transformative moment in the nature of policing (Brayne, 2017; Degeling and Berendt, 2017; Hu, 2017; Manovich, 2018). The application of these and other informational resources to the development of predictive policing has been recognized as presenting a genuine threat to the traditional meaning of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and related justifications for the application of First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to the targets of police attention (Cohen, 2019; Ferguson, 2015, 2016; Maharrey, 2018).

Despite the presence of many transparency-enhancing digital tools, putting such tools together to achieve the desired level of digital transparency, to design entire government systems for digital transparency, remains challenging. Design principles and other design guides are lacking in this area. This article aims to fill this gap. We identify a set of barriers to digital transparency in government, define 16 design principles to overcome such barriers, and evaluate these principles using three case studies from different countries. Some principles apply to projects, others to systems, yet others to entire organizations. To achieve digital transparency, before building and deploying digital solutions, government organizations should build technological and institutional foundations and use such foundations to organize themselves for transparency. The proposed design principles can help develop and apply such foundations.", "venue": "Gov. Inf.

In Philadelphia, focused deterrence was implemented between 2013 and 2016, and although an impact evaluation showed a significant decrease in shootings in targeted areas relative to matched comparison neighborhoods, the effect on targeted gangs was not universal, with some exhibiting no change or an increase in gun-related activity. Here, we employ data on group-level social media usage and content to examine the correlations with gun violence. We find that several factors, including the nature of social media activity by the gang (e.g., extent of activity and who is engaging), are associated with increases in the average rate of gang-attributable shootings during the evaluation period, while content-specific variables (e.g., direct threats towards rivals and law enforcement) were not associated with increases in shootings.

This study explores the trends in this area through the application of the police legitimacy theory. It aims to gather insights into the use of big data to strengthen preventive responses to crimes by law enforcement agencies while also considering the citizens initiatives based on big data abuses. The survey conducted by the Korean Institute of Criminology in August 2015 was used for analysis through structural equation modeling (SEM).

First, in addition to the policies on subsidies and intellectual property (IP) that will affect the propagation of AI in ways close to their effect on other technologies, three policy categories \u2014 privacy, exchange, and liability \u2014 may have a specific impact on the diffusion of AI. The first step in the prohibition process is to identify the shortcomings of current hospital procedures, why we need acute care AI, and eventually how the direction of patient decision-making will shift with the introduction of AI-based research. The second step is to establish a plan to shift the direction of medical education in order to enable physicians to retain control of AI. Medical research would need to rely less on threshold decision-making and more on the prediction, interpretation, and pathophysiological context of contextual time cycles.

Drawing on a 14-month ethnographic study of Korean higher education and 100 in-depth interviews with key actors in this field, this study demonstrates four pathways through which the logic of quantification is embedded into organizations. Specifically, we show how this new logic reshaped organizational structure, practices, power, and culture\u2014changes that in turn buttress and reproduce the logic. Theoretically, this study provides a new perspective on the deep institutionalization of quantification: why quantification is often intractable and \u201cde-quantification\u201d so rare.

Afterwards, three epistemologies of predictive policing are distinguished: mathematical social science, social physics and machine learning. Finally, it is shown that these epistemologies have significant implications for the constitution of predictive knowledge in terms of its genesis, scope, intelligibility and accessibility. It is the different ways future crimes are rendered knowledgeable in order to act upon them that reaffirm or reconfigure the status of criminological knowledge within the criminal justice system, direct the attention of law enforcement agencies to particular types of crimes and criminals and blank out others, satisfy the claim for the meaningfulness of predictions or break with it and allow professionals to understand the algorithmic systems they shall rely on or turn them into a black box.

Our archival analysis of over 4,200 pages of CalGang-related documents identifies quasiexperimental variation in ICE access to CalGang generated by the expiration of an MOU between the State of California and ICE. Based on this variation, we find that immigrants living under high surveillance were more likely to have criminal allegations were filed against them, to be detained, and had shorter case processing times when electronic surveillance is made available to adjacent users. Federal judges do not obviously differentiate between criminal charges stemming from electronic surveillance and those stemming from criminal convictions.

To explore datafication historically and in relation to legal practice and power, I consider it not as an objective and passive undertaking but, rather, as an ideological and performative process that encodes and enacts normative presumptions and desirable futures. The empirical inquiry traverses \u201clevels of analysis\u201d and thus bridges prominent perspectives in sociolegal research.

Substantively, I show how datafication has not simply described, but also transformed, sentencing practice according to a colorblind-carceral imaginary that strives to fix the present in place. By relentlessly translating decisions into data forms that derive from this carceral imaginary, datafication affects judicial action and partakes in sustaining legacies of oppression.

The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations. Transparency by Design is a model that helps organizations design transparent AI systems, by integrating these principles in a step-by-step manner and as an ex-ante value, not as an afterthought.", "venue": "Sci.

We show that such a strategy is used across China by combining ethnography with a computational analysis of a novel dataset of the titles of 197,303 propaganda posts made by 213 Chinese city-level governments on WeChat. We find that Chinese propagandists face intense pressures to demonstrate their effectiveness on social media because their work is heavily quantified\u2013measured, analyzed, and ranked\u2013with metrics such as views and likes. Propagandists use both clickbait and non-propaganda content (e.g., lifestyle tips) to capture clicks, but rely more heavily on clickbait because it does not decrease space available for political propaganda. Government propagandists use clickbait at a rate commensurate with commercial and celebrity social media accounts. The use of clickbait is associated with more views and likes, as well as greater reach of government propaganda outlets and messages.

We use a joint approach, mixing criminology and data science knowledge, to design an explainable predictive policing model. The proposed model (a set of explainable decision trees) can predict police resource requirement across the city and explain this prediction based on human-understandable cues (i.e., past event information, weather, and socio-demographic information). The explainable decision tree is then compared to a non-explainable model (i.e., a neural network) to compare performance. Analyzing the decision tree behaviour revealed multiple relations with established criminology knowledge.

The irregularity of data affects the accuracy of machine learning algorithms and the mass surveillance that depends on them which can be explained by three kinds of known problems encountered in machine learning theory: class imbalance, the curse of dimensionality, and spurious correlations. Proponents of mass surveillance often invoke the distinction between collecting data and metadata, in which the latter is understood as a lesser breach of privacy. Their arguments commonly overlook the ambiguity in the definitions of data and metadata and ignore the ability of machine learning techniques to infer the former from the latter.

Increasingly, however, the work of human monitors has been re-assigned to semi-autonomous computer systems, guided by artificial intelligence resources, and updated routinely through the use of machine learning techniques. The development of these enhanced systems involves a number of related functions that are transforming the nature of policing. My critical examination of this development focuses on the following elements: 1) the capture and use of images from mobile cameras, 2) the analysis of social networks, and 3) the evaluative assessment of members belonging to algorithmically classified groups.

The current COVID-19 pandemic, it seems, is further accelerating the spread of prediction. The prediction of the pandemic yields a pandemic of prediction. In this paper, we explore this dynamic, focusing on contagion models and their transmission back and forth between two domains of society: public health and public safety. We connect this movement with a fundamental duality in the prevention of contagion risk concerning the two sides of being-at-risk and being-a-risk. Both in the spread of a disease and in the spread of criminal behavior, a person at risk can be a risk to others and vice versa. Based on key examples, from this perspective we observe and interpret a circular movement in three phases. In the past, contagion models have moved from public health to public safety, as in the case of the Strategic Subject List used in the policing activity of the Chicago Police Department. In the present COVID-19 pandemic, the analytic tools of policing wander to the domain of public health \u2013 exemplary of this movement is the cooperation between the data infrastructure firm Palantir and the UK government\u2019s public health system NHS. The expectation that in the future the predictive capacities of digital contact tracing apps might spill over from public health to policing is currently shaping the development and use of tools such as the Corona-Warn-App in Germany.

A normative account of transparency is outlined relying on an intuitionist framework rooted in the works of Ross and Robert Audi.

Building on this foundation, the paper examines transparency and duty conflict with a special focus on algorithms in justice and security, recognising that complete transparency can be impossible where duties conflict.

Recent advances in AI have led to its increasing use, but too little is known about the relationship between this distinct form of ICT and to both the exercise of discretion and bureaucratic form along the continuum from street- to system-levels. We articulate a theoretical framework that integrates work on the unique effects of AI on discretion and its relationship to task and organizational context with the theory of system-level bureaucracy. We use this framework to examine two strongly differing cases of public sector AI use: health insurance auditing, and policing. We find AI\u2019s effect on discretion is nonlinear and nonmonotonic as a function of bureaucratic form.

For community residents, particularly gang-associated youth, repeated exposure to traumatic grief causes serious adverse effects that may include negative health outcomes, delinquency, and future violent offenses. The recent proliferation of digital social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide a novel and largely underutilized resource for responding to these issues, particularly among these difficult-to-reach communities. In this paper, we explore the potential for using a human-machine partnered approach, wherein qualitative fieldwork and domain expertise is combined with a computational linguistic analysis of Twitter content among 18 gang territories/neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s South Side. We first employ in-depth interviews and observations to identify common patterns by which residents in gang territories/neighborhoods express traumatic grief on social media. We leverage these qualitative findings, supplemented by domain expertise and computational techniques, to gather both traumatic grief- and gang-related tweets from Twitter. We next utilize supervised machine learning to construct a binary classification algorithm to eliminate irrelevant tweets that may have been gathered by our automated query and extraction techniques. Last, we confirm the validity, or ground truth, of our computational findings by enlisting additional domain expertise and further qualitative analyses of the specific traumatic events discussed in our sample of Twitter content. Using this approach, we find that social media provides useful signals for identifying moments of increased collective traumatic grief among residents in gang territories/neighborhoods. This is the first study to leverage Twitter to systematically ground the collective online articulations of traumatic grief in traumatic offline events occurring in violence-impacted communities.

In some ways, however, advances in creating a \u201cPragmatic Web\u201d have outstripped efforts to create a \u201cSemantic Web\u201d, a fact seen most clearly in the various algorithms that monitor the actions of users and transform them into inferences about the kinds of content they wish to be fed or the kinds of products they want to buy \u2013 algorithms that are at the heart of search engines like Google, recommender systems like that used by Amazon.com, and filtering systems like Facebook\u2019s EdgeRank. The rise of the Pragmatic Web introduces challenges to scholars of pragmatics and discourse analysis, forcing us to rethink fundamental principles of meaning and interaction, including how implicature is created, how inferences are formed, the role of context in assigning meaning to action, and what constitutes a \u201cspeech act\u201d to begin with.

Integration of administration into the constitutional order produced two remarkable changes. First, the everyday work of administration uses forms and vocabularies resembling those of law and the court system. Second, adoption of legally mandated due process protections catalyzed a broader values reorientation, yielding practices that promote social equity and public participation. However, as administrative practice became more law-like, partisans and organized interests made new use of legal tactics to bend administrative decision-making toward their own ends. Common patterns of unequal outcomes in the American legal system thus arise, in similar forms, in administrative settings. Law\u2019s problems have thereby become governance problems. This article elucidates these past and current patterns by reading law and society literature alongside that of public administration and public management. In doing so, it shows that these two fields have long developed in parallel and have much to contribute to each other.

It does so through research into public Wi-Fi infrastructure that has started to appear across the globe and its mobilization as a device for warning the public about emergencies. I focus specifically on an iteration of this infrastructure developing in New York called LinkNYC. According to the infrastructure\u2019s operators, the processes that underpin emergency communication have gradually become \u2018automated\u2019 to accelerate LinkNYC\u2019s deployment during crises. The article pursues three lines of inquiry to explore the automation of security infrastructure, in turn making three correspondent original contributions to wider debates. First, it unpacks the real-time analytics and platform-based data-sharing techniques cultivated to automate emergency communication. Here, I expand understanding of the new forms of automation now integrated into technologies harnessed for security and their practical effects. These forms of automation, I demonstrate secondly, are situated by those governing into wider imaginaries concerning the transformative promise automation bears. I argue that the proliferation of these imaginaries play a crucial role in justifying and dictating the enrolment of new devices into security. Third, it explores how automation affords private companies the opportunity to exercise discretionary decisionmaking that changes how and when infrastructure should operate during emergencies. Developing this argument, I add new dimensions to debates regarding the political ramifications associated with automation by claiming that automation redistributes authority across the public and private organizations that increasingly coordinate in bringing new technologies to bear in the security domain.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 101, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1401511204", "name": "N.
