In this paper, we look at the broad scope of how dashboards are used in practice through an analysis of dashboard examples and documentation about their use. We systematically review the literature surrounding dashboard use, construct a design space for dashboards, and identify major dashboard types. We characterize dashboards by their design goals, levels of interaction, and the practices around them. Our framework and literature review suggest a number of fruitful research directions to better support dashboard design, implementation, and use.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 67, "citationCount": 98, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2031917", "name": "Alper Sarikaya"}, {"authorId": "11192438", "name": "M.
