There is plenty to be said about their positive effects. On the other hand however, some serious negative implications of SM have repeatedly been highlighted in recent years, pointing at various SM threats for society, and its teenagers in particular: from common issues (e.g. digital addiction and polarization) and manipulative influences of algorithms to teenager-specific issues (e.g. body stereotyping). The full impact of current SM platform design \u2013 both at an individual and societal level \u2013 asks for a comprehensive evaluation and conceptual improvement. We extend measures of Collective Well-Being (CWB) to SM communities. As users\u2019 relationships and interactions are a central component of CWB, education is crucial to improve CWB. We thus propose a framework based on an adaptive \u201csocial media virtual companion\u201d for educating and supporting the entire students\u2019 community to interact with SM. The virtual companion will be powered by a Recommender System (CWB-RS) that will optimize a CWB metric instead of engagement or platform profit, which currently largely drives recommender systems thereby disregarding any societal collateral effect. CWB-RS will optimize CWB both in the short term, by balancing the level of SM threat the students are exposed to, as well as in the long term, by adopting an Intelligent Tutor System role and enabling adaptive and personalized 1 ar X iv :2 10 2. 04 21 1v 1 [ cs .C Y ] 2 5 Ja n 20 21 Ognibene et al.

ICT standards development is largely driven by standards developing organizations or standards setting organizations that represent and are informed by the perspectives and interests of the ICT private sector and the public sector. Thus the shaping of the standards is mostly driven by the business, technical, and legal impetus, towards facilitating greater market influence, coordination, integration, interoperability, and legal conformity. The technocentric, business-focused perspective to ICT developments, and corollary to ICT standards development, is distinct from and can be orthogonal to the human-centric perspective that elevates the role and centrality of the human concerns over the technology and business concerns. Notwithstanding the crucial role of business and technology, it remains that at the centre of the 21st century data-driven societies are individuals and end-users who are the primary actants and agents within the technology and data ecosystems. This gives motivation for infusing the human perspectives and values into technology development as well as into ICT standards development. This is more pronounced for cases where the business and technocentric interests are at odds and opposed to the human interests, such as, the need for increased datafication to support Big Data developments versus the need for individuals\u2019privacy preservation. In this research, which is framed through a case study of personal health informatics in the context of sustainable development (i.e., sustainable development goal on \u201chealth and wellbeing\u201d \u2013 SDG3) indicators monitoring, we have undertaken a survey to investigate the human-centric values and attitudes associated with the collection and use of personal data. From this inquiry, the paper highlights and surfaces: individuals attitudes and perceptions around monitoring of social indicators; key considerations associated with data ownership, privacy and confidentiality of data, as well as sharing of personal data within the data ecosystem. The paper then discusses how these findings could inform and be infused into the development of technology artefacts and standards, towards a realization of more human-centric data-informed societies.", "venue": "J.

Elsewhere, I have argued that the occurrences of trust are related to, and affect, preexisting relations, like purchasing, negotiation, communication, and delegation (Taddeo 2010a, b). Trust is not to be considered a relation itself but a property of relations, something that changes the way relations occur. Consider, for example, a case of communication. Alice talks to Bob and she informs him that the grocery store down the road is closed for the day As Bob trusts Alice, he believes her and decides not to walk to the shop to double check, instead he starts searching for an alternative place to shop for his groceries. Between Alice and Bob there is a firstorder relation, the communication, which ranges over the two agents, and there is the second-order property of trust that ranges over the first-order-relation and affects the way it occurs. As a property of relations, trust changes the way relations occur by minimising the effort and commitment for the achievement of a given goal of the agents who decides to trust (the trustor). It does so in two ways. First, the trustor can avoid performing the action necessary to achieve her/his goal her/himself, because s/he can count on the trustee to do it\u2014Bob does not walk to the shop to check whether it is actually closed. Second, the trustor can decide not to supervise the trustee\u2019s performance. Bob does not ask Alice how she knows about the opening times of the shop.

In fact, many legal orders, like Italy, require that, in conflict of laws disputes, courts apply the relevant foreign law using canons of interpretation and rules of application of the original foreign system. Our research hypothesis is that, in interpreting the foreign rule, domestic courts incur interpretive divergences of many kinds among the involved legal systems. Foreign law interpretation may result in linguistic and/or conceptual misalignments, in normative and/or interpretive gaps, and in specific incompatibilities between inner and foreign canons of interpretation. By focusing on interpretive conflicts within one legal system, legal theorists and AI and Law scholars have not yet paid sufficient attention to the issue, even if pluralist logics and argumentation have been applied to legal pluralism and conflict of laws. The present study fills this gap in the literature: it explores the feasibility of a theory for arguing and interpreting in private international law contexts, providing an argument-based conceptual framework that encompasses plausible interpretive interactions. To this end, after addressing the epistemic concerns foreign law raises for domestic judges, the thesis gives a definition of cross-border interpretive incompatibilities and proposes argumentation schemes to reason with interpretive canons coming from different legal systems. An illustrative list of critical questions is used to evaluate the correctness of such interpretive reasoning. Lastly, the thesis presents the first formal developments of the study, based on the concept of meta-argumentation. It is possible to detect two main contributions to knowledge. First, this work identifies the components of foreign law interpretation, an activity with significant practical implications for legal systems today. Secondly, its argument-based analysis paves the way for further formal applications in the domain of AI and Law.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 149, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3329806", "name": "Alessandra Malerba"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["The sheer volume of data to be dealt with is illustrated by the general acceptance that we have entered the 'zettabyte era', in which annual data traffic on global networks exceeds the zettabyte level (Cisco 2016, Floridi 2014).", "Although there is no single recommended text for the course - the material is too broad and diverse - the technical content is roughly matched by Herzog (2015) and the socio-ethical content by Floridi (2014)."], "isInfluential": false, "citingPaper": {"paperId": "184845fbbab973fafb5ad6fb6a7929cdad0332ad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2610213971", "DOI": "10.1108/LM-01-2017-0009"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/184845fbbab973fafb5ad6fb6a7929cdad0332ad", "title": "'The story of data': a socio-technical approach to education for the data librarian role in the CityLIS library school at City, University of London", "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to describe a new approach to education for library/information students in data literacy \u2013 the principles and practice of data collection, manipulation and management \u2013 as a part of the Masters programmes in library and information science (CityLIS) at City, University of London. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe course takes a socio-technical approach, integrating, and giving equal importance to, technical and social/ethical aspects.

Through photographic and video work in digital formats, I explore the movements and arrests of informatic flows that constitute the operation of control, and the potential for resistance that may be felt in the turbulence of the interface, as a dynamic threshold where such flows meet. \nIn this turn to the interface, I theorise the impacts of computationality on the loss of the image as a stable site of representational resistance, with the unsettling of perspectival representation in the topology of informational space and the ambiguity of a digital visuality whose software hides as it shows. When brought together with recent work on the de-materialisation wrought by informational Capital, the digital image comes to be seen as an instantiation of anxiety about the abstracted nature of power that increasingly operates as control. It is less to the digital image itself, but rather to the circulations and patternings of data expressed as light on the screen, that we must attend if we are to confront the digital visuality of control. \nThe \u2018image-machine of control\u2019 is the infrastructure that modulates these data circulations and patternings through inciting the making, sharing and watching of images. Drawing on affect theory, I emphasise the role that affects of insecurity, at the level of the dividuated subject and the abstracted socius, play in inciting an interactivity with the screen on which the State and Corporation alike rely for their accumulation and circulation of data. The digital-visual interface, being the encounter with the screen, becomes a sitemoment to explore its dynamic boundary condition, whose turbulence of data flows may open up \u2018lines of flight\u2019 from the striated grid of control. These lines of flight help us see beyond the workings of the faciality system, and the subject-object relations of the gaze. Specificity of positioning in scopic regimes of control still matters, but posthumanist theorising suggests that such positioning be understood as vector and not point, whose movements we need to stay in touch with. \nUsing digital photography to open up the everyday practice of image-making to its potential to disrupt the informatic flows of control, my first photographic work, medium specific, makes use of photomontage to look at the topology of informational space through its \u2018folds\u2019, as a first experiment in disrupting the tempo of the image-machine\u2019s visual incitements through a \u2018pleating\u2019 of its data. I use haptic photography in the pieces figure ground, surface gaze and touch light to stay in touch with the smooth space of the interface as a time-space of contingency, potentially resistant to the gridded striations of control. \nMy exploration of the contingency of the interface continues with two video works, look screen and moving still, which address its vibrational ontology. I put the concept of the vibrational interface to use in confronting the rhythms of control deployed by the image-machine. Being a rhythm of not only circulation but also capture, not merely movement but also arrest, I suggest that understanding the ontology of the interface in terms of its vibrational forces is useful for disrupting, through its moving stillness, the rhythm of flow and stasis on which control depends.

Towards an Informational Metaphilosophy of Science", "abstract": "In the most general if unconventional terms, science is the study of how man is part of the universe. Philosophy is the study of man\u2019s ideas of the universe and how man differs from the rest of the universe. It has of course been recognized that philosophy and science are not totally disjointed. Science is in any case not a monolithic entity but refers to knowledge as the results of reasoning and both invasive and non-invasive experiment. We argue that the philosophy of science, in studying the foundations, methods and implications of science and the link between philosophy and science, must now take into account the impact of the rapidly developing science and philosophy of information. We suggest that the philosophy of information is in fact a metaphilosophy, since informational processes operate in all the sciences and their philosophies. The simplest definition of (a) metaphilosophy is that of a set of statements about (a) philosophy, and any definition of a metaphilosophy thus requires one of philosophy and of the task of philosophy as well. According to Sellars, \u201cthe aim of philosophy is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term\u201d. In this paper, we focus on the recursive thought underlying those statements as real processes, occurring both in and between the fundamental and the meta-level. We propose a non-standard logic, Logic in Reality, as the logic of those processes. The metaphilosophy of information is thus a framework for talking about the scientific aspects of philosophy and the philosophical aspects of science. Both Logic in Reality and the metaphilosophy of information provide a basis for understanding the physical and epistemological dynamics of existence, that is, from where the properties of things come that enable both them and the concepts of them to contrast, conflict and ultimately \u201chang together\u201d. We conclude that the current convergence of science and philosophy under the influence of information science constitutes a revolution in philosophy, that is, in how science and philosophy are done. Many of the issues discussed in the metaphilosophy of information may thus be viewed as part of an emerging informational metaphilosophy of science.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount": 12, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Philosophy"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1500391598", "name": "Kun Wu"}, {"authorId": "1793555", "name": "J.

Recent developments in the field of scientific information resource provision lead us to the key research question, namely,what is the coverage of freely available information sources when writing doctoral theses, and whether the academic library can assume the leading role as a direct intermediator for information users. Method.Citation analysis of doctoral theses was conducted in the summer of 2015. A total of thirty-nine theses (with 6,998 references) defended at Vilnius University at the end of 2014 was selected (30 per cent of all defended theses). Theses were randomly chosen from different research fields: the humanities, social sciences, biomedical sciences, technological sciences, and physical sciences. Analysis.The research team was tasked with identifying whether certain resources could be found in the eCatalogue of an academic library, its subscribed databases, freely available online (through Google or Google Scholar), or whether the resources from the library`s subscribed databases are identical to those which are freely available. The data gathering process included such resource categories as journal papers, printed and electronic books or book chapters, and other documents (legal reports, conference papers, newspaper articles, Websites, theses, etc.). Conclusions. Library collections and subscribed databases could cover up to 80 per cent of all information resources used in doctoral theses. Among the most significant findings to emerge from this study is the fact that on average more than half (57 per cent) of all utilised information resources were freely available or were accessed without library support. We may presume that the library as a direct intermediator for information users is potentially important and irreplaceable only in four out of ten attempts of PhD students to seek information.", "venue": "Inf.

Firstly, the paper applies the Batesonian ecology of mind for constructing a unified roboethical framework which endorses a flat ontology embracing multiple forms of agency, borrowing elements from Floridi\u2019s information ethics, classic virtue ethics, Felix Guattari\u2019s ecosophy, Braidotti\u2019s posthumanism, and the Japanese animist doctrine of Rinri. The proposed framework wishes to act as a pragmatic solution to the endless dispute regarding the nature of consciousness or the natural/artificial dichotomy and as a further argumentation against the recognition of future artificial agency as a potential existential threat. Secondly, schismogenic analysis is employed to describe the emergence of the hostile human\u2013robot cultural contact, tracing its origins in the early scientific discourse of man\u2013machine symbiosis up to the contemporary countermeasures against superintelligent agents. Thirdly, Bateson\u2019s double bind theory is utilized as an analytic methodological tool of humanity\u2019s collective agency, leading to the hypothesis of collective schizophrenic symptomatology, due to the constancy and intensity of confronting messages emitted by either proponents or opponents of artificial intelligence.

The advances define the changes in science education and, consequently, gained broad attention of educational researchers. Despite the abundance of opinions, approaches, and interpretations of the changes in science education, two key alternative interpretations explain the ICT integration phenomenon. The first interpretation considers ICT as a tool for enhancing classical science education by providing different emerging technological means. In contrast, an alternative interpretation considers ICT much wider than a tool. Supporters of this interpretation perceive thus digital science class as a new phenomenon in education, since the mentioned technologies changed the class qualitatively, brought to it a new essence, which is not just a sum of the added technologies. In our research, we have chosen the second interpretation as our assumption. We hypothesize that the changes of teachers\u2019 worldview are vital for their understanding the role of technology in science education in its transformative stage. To check this hypothesis we propose a new conceptual framework for study and analysis the ICT integration phenomenon in science education. The proposed framework is a modification of SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition) model for perception of technology. Our modified SAMR framework can be used for assessing the teachers\u2019 worldview regarding ICT integration in science education. Specifically, the teachers\u2019 awareness about such kind of assessment opens a way for their reflexing and improving their own teaching, which in turn affects their learners.

It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places. These geographies of information about places matter because they shape how we are able to find and understand different parts of the world. Places invisible or discounted in representations are invisible in practice to many people. In other words, geographic augmentations are much more than just representations of places: they are part of the place itself; they shape it rather than simply reflect it. This fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are immutable means that annotations of place emerge as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations. This paper therefore explores how information geographies have their own geographic distributions: geographies of access, of participation, and of representation. The paper offers a deliberately broad survey of a range of key platforms that mediate, host, and deliver different types of geographic information. It does so using a combination of existing statistics and bespoke data not previously mapped or analysed. Through this effort, the paper demonstrates that in addition to the geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communication, uneven geographies of participation and representation are also evident and in some cases are being amplified rather than alleviated. In other words, the paper comprehensively shows one important facet of contemporary information geographies: that geographic information itself is characterised by a host of uneven geographies. The paper concludes that there are few signs that global informational peripheries are achieving comparable levels of participation or representation with traditional information cores, despite the hopes that the fast-paced spread of the internet to three billion people might change this pattern.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount": 88, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144643908", "name": "Mark Graham"}, {"authorId": "2741769", "name": "S.

This article explores the emerging intelligence-led, informationist conception of UN peacekeeping against the backdrop of increasingly complex peacekeeping mandates and precarious security conditions. New peacekeeping with its heightened commitment to information as a political resource and the endorsement of offensive military action within robust mandates reflects the multiple and conflicting trajectories generated by asymmetric conflicts, the responsibility to protect and a technology-driven information revolution.

In light of cultural globalization and digital identity, a contemporary re-interpretation of classical notions like citizenship is imperative. What does it mean to be a citizen in the Digital Era?

Our hypothesis is that the dynamical feedback relation between the physical and digital individual\u2019s experience promotes the embodiment of a hybrid identity from which the hybrid being emerges.
