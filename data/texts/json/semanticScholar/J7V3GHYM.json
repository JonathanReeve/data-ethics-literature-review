The recently held I/O conference (2015) \u200bwebsite is a product which is built on this new visual  language. After a year of public use, the website provides a perfect opportunity to understand and  evaluate this language. In addition, it has provided an avenue to validate the theory and rationale based  on which it stands. The overarching goal in developing the visual language was to unify the design across  all Google products and help users understand their actions in a natural way. In addition, Material design,  isn\u2019t about how to use color, categorize timing or standardize the elevation of an object. It is built to  combine classic design details and create a purposeful user experience. It has been created to give the  charge of control to the users and make them feel powerful.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2099437175", "name": "Rohan Singh Bondili"}]}
