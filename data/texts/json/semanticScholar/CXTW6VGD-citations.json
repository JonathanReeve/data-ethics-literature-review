Studying technology development teams' engagement with the ethical aspects of their work is important, but engagement with ethical issues is an unobservable construct without agreement on what observable factors comprise it. Ethical sensitivity (ES), a construct studied in medicine, accounting, and other professions, offers a framework of observable factors by operationalizing ethical engagement in workplaces into component parts. However, ES has primarily been studied as a property of individuals rather than groups and in professions outside of computing. This paper uses a corpus of 108 ES studies from 1985-2020 to adapt the framework for studies of technology design teams. From the ES corpus, we build an umbrella framework that conceptualizes ES as comprising the moment of noticing an ethical problem (recognition), the process of building understanding of the situation (particularization), and the decision about what to do (judgment). This framework makes theoretical and methodological contributions to the study of how ethics are operationalized on design teams. We find that ethical sensitivity provides useful language for studies of collaboration and communication around ethics; suggests opportunities for, and evaluations of, ethical interventions for design workplaces; and connects team members' backgrounds, educational experiences, work practices, and organizational factors to design decisions. Simultaneously, existing research in HCI and CSCW addresses the limited range of research methods currently employed in the ES literature, adding rich, contextualized data about situated and embodied ethical practice to the theory.", "venue": "Proc.

Then, we ran an aggregated model of the previous three including all significant predictors. Results Like of features, perceived control and trust in mobile marketers had the highest impact on comfortability with data sensing and they also predicted intentions to accept app permissions. Conclusions People are more comfortable with sharing their data and more willing to take the risks of using mobile sensing apps if they find that the features provide them with valuable feedback related to their health.

Labor and classification feed into Netflix's production of culture via appropriation on Twitter and algorithmic decision-making within both the recommendation system and broader AI-driven production practices.Social implicationsAssemblages that include algorithmic recommendation systems are imbued with structural inequities and therefore unable to be fixed by merely diversifying cultural industries or retooling algorithms on streaming platforms. It is necessary to understand systemic injustices within these systems so that we may imagine and enact just alternatives.Originality/valueFindings demonstrate that via surveillance tactics that exploit people's labor for promotional gains, enforce normative classification schemes, and culminate in normative cultural productions, Netflix engenders practices that regulate bodies and culture in ways that exemplify interconnections between people, machines, and social institutions.

While models trained on this type of data have shown promising out-of-domain generalizability, it is still unclear what the sources of such improvements are. We investigate the benefits of CAD for social NLP models by focusing on three social computing constructs \u2014 sentiment, sexism, and hate speech. Assessing the performance of models trained with and without CAD across different types of datasets, we find that while models trained on CAD show lower in-domain performance, they generalize better out-of-domain.

Social media offers a rich environment for contextualizing and predicting users\u2019 self-reported burden of depression. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods are commonly employed in analyzing user-generated sentiment on social media. In the forthcoming systematic review, we will examine the content validity of these computer-based health surveillance models with respect to standard diagnostic frameworks. Drawing from a clinical perspective, we will attempt to establish a normative judgment about the strengths of these modern AI applications in the detection of depression. Methods We will perform a systematic review of English and German language publications from 2010 to 2020 in PubMed, APA PsychInfo, Science Direct, EMBASE Psych, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria span cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled studies, in addition to reports on conference proceedings. The systematic review will exclude some gray source materials, specifically editorials, newspaper articles, and blog posts. Our primary outcome is self-reported depression, as expressed on social media. Secondary outcomes will be the types of AI methods used for social media depression screen, and the clinical validation procedures accompanying these methods. In a second step, we will utilize the evidence-strengthening Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study type (PICOS) tool to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following the independent assessment of the evidence sources by two authors for the risk of bias, the data extraction process will culminate in a thematic synthesis of reviewed studies. Discussion We present the protocol for a systematic review which will consider all existing literature from peer reviewed publication sources relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes. The completed review will discuss depression as a self-reported health outcome in social media material. We will examine the computational methods, including AI and machine learning techniques which are commonly used for online depression surveillance. Furthermore, we will focus on standard clinical assessments, as indicating content validity, in the design of the algorithms. The methodological quality of the clinical construct of the algorithms will be evaluated with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework. We conclude the study with a normative judgment about the current application of AI to screen for depression on social media.

The point of departure for these explorations consists of the author\u2019s past and ongoing studies of the role and use of a closed grief support group on Facebook for bereaved parents \u2013 a community of which the author is a member. The aim is not to provide ready solutions for \u201chow to do ethics,\u201d but rather to contribute to the collective and ongoing work initiated by the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR), among others, and to recognize the necessity of ethical pluralism, cross-cultural awareness and an interdisciplinary approach.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis is an explorative study, drawing on an (auto)ethnographic case study. The case serves as a point of departure for discussing the complexities of methodological, ethical and emotional challenges of studying sensitive and vulnerable communities online from the perspective of simultaneously being a researcher and a research subject.\n\n\nFindings\nBeing a researcher and a research subject rolled into one, as it were, presents both opportunities and challenges. To conduct responsible research from both these perspectives pose high demands on the researchers\u2019 ethical as well as emotional capacities and responsibilities. Hopes and expectancies of the community under study might put the researcher into a dilemma, ethical aspects of anonymity and informed consent might have to be reconsidered as well as emotional challenges of engaging in and with sensitive research, all of which makes for a complex balancing act. Ethics and methods are inextricably intertwined, so are the emotional challenges of conducting sensitive research intermingled. Studying vulnerable individuals and closed communities online highlights the necessity for case and context sensitive research and for flexibility, adaptivity and mindfulness of the researcher. It also highlights the importance of discussing and questioning theoretical, methodological and ethical developments for studying everyday life practices online.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe challenges encountered in this case study contribute to the experientially grounded approach to research ethics emphasized in AoIR\u2019s ethics guidelines. This case offers an opportunity to explore and discuss complex issues arising from the researcher\u2019s insider position in a closed group devoted to the sensitive topic of supporting bereaved parents. Further, it highlights the necessity for research to be case and context sensitive as well as for the researcher and the research design to be flexible and adaptive.

The Ethics Review Committee (ERC) is the key oversight mechanism designated to ensure ethics review. Whether or not this governance mechanism is still fit for purpose in the data-driven research context remains a debated issue among research ethics experts. Main text In this article, we seek to address this issue in a twofold manner. First, we review the strengths and weaknesses of ERCs in ensuring ethical oversight. Second, we map these strengths and weaknesses onto specific challenges raised by big data research. We distinguish two categories of potential weakness. The first category concerns persistent weaknesses, i.e., those which are not specific to big data research, but may be exacerbated by it. The second category concerns novel weaknesses, i.e., those which are created by and inherent to big data projects. Within this second category, we further distinguish between purview weaknesses related to the ERC\u2019s scope (e.g., how big data projects may evade ERC review) and functional weaknesses, related to the ERC\u2019s way of operating. Based on this analysis, we propose reforms aimed at improving the oversight capacity of ERCs in the era of big data science. Conclusions We believe the oversight mechanism could benefit from these reforms because they will help to overcome data-intensive research challenges and consequently benefit research at large.", "venue": "BMC medical ethics", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 121, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "153227474", "name": "Agata Ferretti"}, {"authorId": "3453968", "name": "M.

Though there are works focusing on Sinophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic, less attention has been given to the recent surge in Islamophobia. A large number of positive cases arising out of the religious Tablighi Jamaat gathering has driven people towards forming anti-Muslim communities around hashtags like #coronajihad, #tablighijamaatvirus on Twitter. In addition to the online spaces, the rise in Islamophobia has also resulted in increased hate crimes in the real world. Hence, an investigation is required to create interventions. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale quantitative study linking Islamophobia with COVID-19. In this paper, we present CoronaBias dataset which focuses on anti-Muslim hate spanning four months, with over 410,990 tweets from 244,229 unique users. We use this dataset to perform longitudinal analysis. We find the relation between the trend on Twitter with the offline events that happened over time, measure the qualitative changes in the context associated with the Muslim community, and perform macro and micro topic analysis to find prevalent topics. We also explore the nature of the content, focusing on the toxicity of the URLs shared within the tweets present in the CoronaBias dataset. Apart from the content-based analysis, we focus on user analysis, revealing that the portrayal of religion as a symbol of patriotism played a crucial role in deciding how the Muslim community was perceived during the pandemic.

We then provide a conceptualisation of methodological data fairness that can complement data management principles such as FAIR by enhancing the actionability of social media data for future research. We highlight the forms that methodological data fairness can take at different stages of the research process and identify practical steps through which researchers can ensure that their practices and outcomes are scientifically sound as well as fair to society at large.

Given that some products are harmful to the health of consumers, it is important for marketing associated with these products to be subject to public health surveillance. However, terms of service (TOS) governing the use of brand website content may impede such important research.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The aim of this study is to explore the TOS for brand websites with public health significance to assess possible legal and ethical challenges for conducting research on consumer product websites.\n \n \n METHODS\n Using Statista, we purposefully constructed a sample of 15 leading American tobacco, alcohol, psychiatric pharmaceutical, fast-food, and gun brands that have associated websites. We developed and implemented a structured coding system for the TOS on these websites and coded for the presence versus absence of different types of restriction that might impact the ability to conduct research.\n \n \n RESULTS\n All TOS stated that by accessing the website, users agreed to abide by the TOS (15/15, 100%). A total of 11 out of 15 (73%) websites had age restrictions in their TOS. All alcohol brand websites (5/15, 33%) required users to enter their age or date of birth before viewing website content. Both websites for tobacco brands (2/15, 13%) further required that users register and verify their age and identity to access any website content and agree that they use tobacco products. Only one website (1/15, 7%) allowed users to display, download, copy, distribute, and translate the website content as long as it was for personal and not commercial use. A total of 33% (5/15) of TOS unconditionally prohibited or put substantial restrictions on all of these activities and/or failed to specify if they were allowed or prohibited. Moreover, 87% (13/15) of TOS indicated that website access could be restricted at any time. A total of 73% (11/15) of websites specified that violating TOS could result in deleting user content from the website, revoking access by having the user\u2019s Internet Protocol address blocked, terminating log-in credentials, or enforcing legal action resulting in civil or criminal penalties.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n TOS create complications for public health surveillance related to e-marketing on brand websites. Recent court opinions have reduced the risk of federal criminal charges for violating TOS on public websites, but this risk remains unclear for private websites. The public health community needs to establish standards to guide and protect researchers from the possibility of legal repercussions related to such efforts.\n", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "16236515", "name": "C.

This type of research is sometimes considered as observation of public behaviour, and therefore exempt from ethical review. This type of research, however, raises ethical issues with respect to the public/private nature of online spaces, consent, and anonymity in the online environment. This project examines research ethics guidelines for recommendations regarding the use of harvested online data, identifying best practices for researchers who engage in this type of research. Introduction Online social environments, including social media platforms and online discussion groups, provide important platforms for individual expression and interpersonal connection. These platforms also provide researchers with a source of data that can be mined for valuable insight into social issues. The advantages of these data for research are myriad, and include limited costs (time and money) for data collection, access to information on sensitive issues, and an absence of reactivity. At the same time, use of these data, which are generated by and about individuals, warrants careful ethical consideration. Research ethics guidelines, including the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS2) in Canada, provide guidance to researchers and research ethics boards (REBs) tasked with making decisions and recommendations regarding the ethical conduct of research involving human participants. This guidance, however, is variable and often incomplete, with the result that ethical considerations and practices vary substantially between researchers and across institutions. This project examines research ethics guidelines, including the TCPS2 and others, with respect to their coverage of and recommendations concerning research involving the harvesting of social media data. The results summarize the treatment of these issues in guidelines, available in English, that apply to research and researchers in Canada and internationally, culminating with a set of best ethical practices for research that involves this type of data. Research Ethics Issues and Guidelines Online social media posts, including tweets, online discussion group interactions, Facebook updates, and listerv archives, provide a rich source of \u2018naturally occurring, everyday talk\u2019 (Sixsmith and Murray, 2001, p. 424) \u2013 precisely the kind of data that, according to Potter and Wetherell (1995), offer deep insight into social phenomena. Ethical issues arise, however, with any use of data from or about people, and harvested data from online social interactions is no exception. Researchers and those focused on the ethics of human subjects research have long recognized that online research presents new and specific ethical issues, potentially requiring new ethical approaches (see, e.g., Elgesem, 2002; Eysenbach & Till, 2001; Flicker et al., 2004; Neuhaus & Webmoor, 2012; King, 1996; Swirsky et al., 2014; Taylor & Pagliari, 2018, Vitak et al., 2016). The harvesting of online productions and interactions for research purposes presents particular challenges, revolving around the issues of participant autonomy (including questions of consent), and participant anonymity and confidentiality. Under many research ethics guidelines harvesting of online social media data is a form of observational research that, if carried out in \u2018public\u2019 venues, may be exempt from ethical review. Questions arise, however, regarding the public/private nature of online spaces \u2013 and, if the spaces are deemed \u2018private\u2019 (or at least not so \u2018public\u2019 as to remove the requirement for ethical review), issues of consent and anonymity/confidentiality become paramount. Some research ethics guidelines (e.g., the TCPS2) provide limited specific guidance regarding this type of online research; others, such as the guidelines provided by the Association of Internet Researchers, (Franzke et al., 2020) provide much more focused and detailed recommendations. Researchers and REBs considering the ethics of this type of research would benefit from a comprehensive and integrated summary of the ethical considerations and approaches available in various guidelines: it is exactly such a summary that we present here. Methodology A total of 31 research ethics guidelines, written in English, were identified through a combination of methods including Google searches (e.g., for \u2018research ethics\u2019 and \u2018ethics guidelines), review of research using harvested online data for mention of research guidelines, and review of publications addressing online research methods for cited guidelines, and specific search of the websites of North American universities for ethics guidelines.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47477913", "name": "S.

The DMCA also includes a triennial policymaking process that considers exemptions to the law to protect \"lawful users\" from adverse effects.

Given that some products are harmful to the health of consumers, it is important for marketing associated with these products to be subject to public health surveillance. However, terms of service (TOS) governing the use of brand website content may impede such important research. Objective The aim of this study is to explore the TOS for brand websites with public health significance to assess possible legal and ethical challenges for conducting research on consumer product websites. Methods Using Statista, we purposefully constructed a sample of 15 leading American tobacco, alcohol, psychiatric pharmaceutical, fast-food, and gun brands that have associated websites. We developed and implemented a structured coding system for the TOS on these websites and coded for the presence versus absence of different types of restriction that might impact the ability to conduct research. Results All TOS stated that by accessing the website, users agreed to abide by the TOS (15/15, 100%). A total of 11 out of 15 (73%) websites had age restrictions in their TOS. All alcohol brand websites (5/15, 33%) required users to enter their age or date of birth before viewing website content. Both websites for tobacco brands (2/15, 13%) further required that users register and verify their age and identity to access any website content and agree that they use tobacco products. Only one website (1/15, 7%) allowed users to display, download, copy, distribute, and translate the website content as long as it was for personal and not commercial use. A total of 33% (5/15) of TOS unconditionally prohibited or put substantial restrictions on all of these activities and/or failed to specify if they were allowed or prohibited. Moreover, 87% (13/15) of TOS indicated that website access could be restricted at any time. A total of 73% (11/15) of websites specified that violating TOS could result in deleting user content from the website, revoking access by having the user\u2019s Internet Protocol address blocked, terminating log-in credentials, or enforcing legal action resulting in civil or criminal penalties. Conclusions TOS create complications for public health surveillance related to e-marketing on brand websites. Recent court opinions have reduced the risk of federal criminal charges for violating TOS on public websites, but this risk remains unclear for private websites.

Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us; ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 244, "citationCount": 82, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1701708450", "name": "Shakir Mohamed"}, {"authorId": "1799412130", "name": "Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Png"}, {"authorId": "103087275", "name": "William S.

Objective This study aimed to investigate individuals\u2019 perspectives about sharing different types of sensor data beyond the research context, specifically with doctors, electronic health record (EHR) systems, and family members. Methods A questionnaire assessed participants\u2019 comfort with sharing six types of sensed data: physical activity, mood, sleep, communication logs, location, and social activity. Participants were asked about their comfort with sharing these data with three different recipients: doctors, EHR systems, and family members. A series of principal component analyses (one for each data recipient) was performed to identify clusters of sensor data types according to participants\u2019 comfort with sharing them. Relationships between recipients and sensor clusters were then explored using generalized estimating equation logistic regression models. Results A total of 211 participants completed the questionnaire. The majority were female (171/211, 81.0%), and the mean age was 38 years (SD 10.32). Principal component analyses consistently identified two clusters of sensed data across the three data recipients: \u201chealth information,\u201d including sleep, mood, and physical activity, and \u201cpersonal data,\u201d including communication logs, location, and social activity.

The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the marketing strategies used by owners of small businesses to maintain their organization through the initial 5 years of operation. Methods: The population included 5 physical therapy business owners in northeastern Florida. The conceptual framework for this study was the brand equity model, and data were collected through semistructured interviews, online company marketing materials, and archival company documents. Yin\u2019s 5-step analysis guided the data analysis process. Member checking, transcript review, and triangulation were used to validate the study data. Results: The participants validated marketing strategies consistent with Aaker\u2019s [18] brand equity model and review of the literature. The findings showed that small business owners used brand awareness, relationship marketing, perceived quality, online marketing, and WOM marketing. Conclusion: The results of this study align with the evidence in the current literature. Owners who use marketing strategies to sustain their business are more likely to be successful. Small business owners who utilize word-of-mouth, brand awareness, perceived quality, and relationship marketing with their customers can ultimately sustain their businesses.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 217, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46743636", "name": "M.

When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21% TPR, 66.71% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window.

Although substantial and diverse literature touches on this dissonance from a variety of perspectives, the problem is illustrated most clearly by the 2011 to 2017 process undertaken to \u201cmodernize\u201d the Common Rule, the federal regulations for the protection of human research subjects. During this process, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) sought public comment on a wide array of challenges they felt were not addressed adequately in existing regulations, and that they hoped to address in proposed revisions. \n \nThe most widely debated proposal aimed to address a perception that a long-standing policy allowing the research use of nonidentified biospecimens without informed consent no longer made sense given the potential of genomic technologies to reidentify such samples.1 OHRP, recognizing concerns that existing regulations created undue burdens on very low-risk research, also proposed a plan to allow investigators to use a decision tool to determine whether a study would be \u201cexcluded\u201d from IRB review. Proposals intended to address these and other concerns prompted critiques in the scholarly literature and in comments submitted to OHRP during the public comment period. Ultimately, the most controversial proposals, including requiring informed consent for nonidentified biospecimens research, were not part of the final rule published in January 2017 on the final day of the Obama administration. Two years after it was published, this final rule was implemented in January 2019. \n \nAs leaders of a multi-disciplinary team working on the ethical and regulatory challenges raised by biorepository research in multi-site networks, we believe that both the controversy surrounding the OHRP proposals and the modest outcome of this six-year process are symptoms of a larger challenge. The regulatory revision process initiated by OHRP focused primarily on the transformation of biomedical science. Critically, however, it did not adequately consider the transformation that has occurred with regard to cultural perspectives on a range of critical issues relevant to the oversight of research with human subjects. These include, but are not limited to: changing perspectives on the right to privacy (and limits thereto), power imbalances between experts and lay people, trust in institutions, and individual ownership and control of data and biomaterials. OHRP, and the biomedical research community at large, have not resolved important questions about the oversight of human subjects research because we have not sufficiently accounted for the ways that society and societal norms have shifted since the Belmont Report was published 1979 and 45 CFR 46 Subpart A (what we now call the Common Rule) was adopted in 1981. \n \nIt is time to undertake a different strategy for working toward the modernization of oversight and governance of research with humans. First, we need to revisit the principles articulated in the Belmont Report. If we aim to settle on an ethical framework that supports the development of policies, what ethical commitments and ideas must be included? Are additional ethical principles needed to ground this effort? Second, we need to conduct empirical research and public engagement activities to understand the views of diverse stakeholders on the ethical basis for policies on human subjects research. What implications do the Belmont principles hold for us today? Third, we need a process whereby this more contemporary interpretation of principles to guide human research ethics can be translated into policy and practice, with a focus that extends beyond the Common Rule to take a more comprehensive and global view of research oversight and governance. This work would recognize that changing societal contexts calls for changing approaches to process: a repeat of the original Belmont process would be an anachronism. While the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research successfully developed the original Belmont Report, it no longer makes sense for a small and distinguished group of scholars to gather at a conference center over a three-year period.

We show that younger generations are more open to intercaste marriage, yet attitudes are based on a complex function of social status beyond their own caste. In examining the desired qualities in a spouse, we find that individuals open to intercaste marriage are more individualistic in the qualities they desire, rather than favoring family-related qualities, which mirrors larger societal trends away from collectivism.

A perspective oriented to humane and social values is adopted, formulating the challenges in terms of the impact of emerging intelligent interactive technologies on human life both at the individual and societal levels. Seven Grand Challenges are identified and presented in this article: Human-Technology Symbiosis; Human-Environment Interactions; Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well-being, Health and Eudaimonia; Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning and Creativity; and Social Organization and Democracy. Although not exhaustive, they summarize the views and research priorities of an international interdisciplinary group of experts, reflecting different scientific perspectives, methodological approaches and application domains. Each identified Grand Challenge is analyzed in terms of: concept and problem definition; main research issues involved and state of the art; and associated emerging requirements.

This multiple case study explored user-centered clinical BCI device design strategies used by computer scientists designing BCI assistive technologies to meet patient-centered outcomes. The population for the study encompassed computer scientists experienced with clinical BCI assistive technology design located in the midwestern, northeastern, and southern regions of the United States, as well as western Europe. The multi-motive information systems continuance model was the conceptual framework for the study. Interview data were collected from 7 computer scientists and 28 archival documents. Guided by the concepts of user-centered design and patient-centered outcomes, thematic analysis was used to identify codes and themes related to computer science and the design of BCI assistive technology devices. Notable themes included customization of clinical BCI devices, consideration of patient/caregiver interaction, collective data management, and evolving technology. Implications for social change based on the findings from this research include focus on meeting individualized patient-centered outcomes; enhancing collaboration between researchers, caregivers, and patients in BCI device development; and reducing the possibility of abandonment or disuse of clinical BCI assistive technology devices.

In 2001, the Committee on Quality of Healthcare in America and the Institute of Medicine identified patient-centeredness as 1 of 6 improvement goals to improve quality of care for the 21st century. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore patient-centered strategies that healthcare managers used to reduce the cost of healthcare for elderly patients without reducing the quality of patient care. The conceptual framework that grounded this study was patient-centered care, and the opposing theory was the primary care team model. Data were collected using semistructured interviews with 6 healthcare leaders selected via purposive sampling throughout Virginia and a review of healthcare facilities\u2019 documents and website pages. Data were analyzed using Yin\u2019s 5-step process, which led to the identification of 4 themes. Themes that emerged from the study included patient-centered care matters, management leadership strategies, control methods for monitoring costs, and maximizing community healthcare services. The implications of this study for positive social change include the potential to improve the delivery of healthcare for elderly patients and access to quality patient-centered care that supports cost-reducing strategies healthcare managers can employ to increase profits through value-based healthcare.

This paper studies how scientific papers represent human research subjects in HCML. Using mental health status prediction on social media as a case study, we conduct thematic discourse analysis on 55 papers to examine these representations. We identify five discourses that weave a complex narrative of who the human subject is in this research: Disorder/Patient, Social Media, Scientific, Data/Machine Learning, and Person. We show how these five discourses create paradoxical subject and object representations of the human, which may inadvertently risk dehumanization.

Students remain concerned about the scope and detail of surveillance of their learning behavior, their privacy, their control over what data are collected, the purpose of the collection, and the implications of any analysis. Questions arise as to the extent to which students are aware of the benefits and risks inherent in the exchange of their data, and whether they are willing to exchange personal data for more effective and supported learning experiences. This study reports on the views of entry level students at the Open University (OU) in 2018. The primary aim is to explore differences between stated attitudes to privacy and their online behaviors, and whether these same attitudes extend to their university's uses of their (personal) data. The analysis indicates, inter alia, that there is no obvious relationship between how often students are online or their awareness of/concerns about privacy issues in online contexts and what they actually do to protect themselves. Significantly though, the findings indicate that students overwhelmingly have an inherent trust in their university to use their data appropriately and ethically.

When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21% TPR, 66.71% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window.

The ethical sensitivities around location are further heightened in the context of research into such digital sexual cultures. Public sexual cultures involving men who have sex with men operate both in spaces \u201cmeant\u201d for public sex (e.g., gay saunas and dark rooms) and spaces \u201cnot meant\u201d for public sex (e.g., shopping centers and public toilets). The app in question facilitates this activity. We developed a web scraper that carefully collected selected data from the app and that data were then analyzed to help identify ethical issues. We used a mixture of content analysis using Python scripts, geovisualisation software and manual qualitative coding techniques. Our findings, which are methodological rather than theoretical in nature, center on the ethics associated with generating, processing, presenting, archiving and deleting big data in a context where harassment, imprisonment, physical harm and even death occur.

Despite high costs, health care quality lags behind other high-income countries; yet, over 70% of change initiatives fail.

Despite high costs, health care quality lags behind other high-income countries; yet, over 70% of change initiatives fail. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore strategies primary care leaders use for implementing quality improvement initiatives to improve patient outcomes and reduce waste in primary care facilities. The target population consisted of 3 health care leaders of 3 primary care facilities in southern California who successfully implemented quality improvement initiatives. The conceptual framework for this study was Kotter\u2019s 8-step of change management. Data were collected through face-to-face semistructured interviews with senior health care managers, document review, and quality reports. Member checking of interview transcripts strengthened the credibility of the findings. Data analysis included Yin\u2019s 5-phase process, which consisted of compiling, disassembling, reassembling, interpreting, and concluding the data. Themes emerged from the use of methodological triangulation of data. The themes included communication, leadership support, inclusive decision-making, and employee recognition. The implications of the findings of this study for positive social change include assisting primary care leaders in improving strategies for implementing quality improvement initiatives to increase efficiency, reduce health care cost, and improve patient and community health.

Yet, little guidance exists to inform the ethical design and the IRB\u2019s regulatory review of MISST research. MISST tools/methods produce personal health data that is voluminous and granular and, which may not be subject to policies like the Health Information Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA). The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) database was used to identify the number, nature and scope of MISST-related studies supported by the NIH at three time points: 2005, 2010 and 2015. The goal was to: 1-examine the extent to which the NIH is supporting this research and, 2-identify how these tools are being used in research. The number of funded MISST research projects increased 384% from 2005 to 2015. Results revealed that while funding of MISST research is growing, it only represented about 1% of the total NIH budget in 2015. However, the number of institutes, agencies, and centers supporting MISST research increased by roughly 50%. Additionally, the scope of MISST research is diverse ranging from use of social media to track disease transmission to personalized interventions delivered through mobile health applications.

Compounded challenges exist when broker evaluation strategies are not effective or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II compliant. This qualitative, single case study, built on efficient capital market hypothesis and innovative disruption theory, was focused on effective broker evaluation strategies after MiFID II in Switzerland. The sample consisted of 4 buy-side traders, who shared their unique perspectives. Methodological triangulation was achieved through semistructured interviews, a review of the institution\u2019s publicly available data, and a literature review. The data analysis process consisted of a manual and systematic coding procedure for the sources of inquiry. In the findings, 3 strategies emerged: improvement of the existing organizational structure of the internal voting process, creation of advanced resources and internal technology as well as automation, and improvement of communication internally and externally to expand the trading desk profitability. Participants agreed that, although not regulatory or necessary in Switzerland yet, the broker review process at the organization under study needed to change dramatically to reach European MiFID II compliance. Implications for positive social change include strategies to help traders, trading desk leaders, and bank managers achieve regulatory compliance with MiFID II. The insight gained from this research may help banks and brokers to improve investment responsibility, broaden insight on research, trading, and client service, and promote stronger enforcement of regulations of electronic trading.

With this in mind, we report on an exploratory survey of Twitter users\u2019 perceptions of the use of tweets in research. Within our survey sample, few users were previously aware that their public tweets could be used by researchers, and the majority felt that researchers should not be able to use tweets without consent.

Using qualitative coding and quantitative measures, we characterize and categorize the nature of the content. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze patterns of choices for privacy settings.

Recent reports showed that alarmingly high numbers of people in vulnerable populations are not reached by preventative efforts. Despite technology improvement, we are not yet able to identify populations that are most susceptible to HIV infections. In order to enable evidencebased prevention, we are studying new methods to identify HIV at-risk populations, exploiting Twitter posts as possible indicators of HIV risk. Our research on social network analysis and machine learning outlined the feasibility of using tweets as monitoring tool for HIV-related risk at the demographic, geographical, and social network level. However, this approach highlights ethical dilemmas in three different areas: data collection and analysis, risk inference through imperfect probabilistic approaches, and data-driven prevention. We contribute a description, analysis and discussion of ethics based on our 2-year experience with clinicians, IRBs, and local HIV communities in San Diego, California.
