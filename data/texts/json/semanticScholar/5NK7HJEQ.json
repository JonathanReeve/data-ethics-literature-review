Like many of his contemporaries, Disney imagined homes that would attend to their inhabitants\u2019 every need, and he regarded the home as a site of unending technological progress. This fixation on \u201cspace-age\u201d technology, with its promise of domestic bliss, marked an important mid-twentieth-century shift in understandings of the American home. In A Small World , Davin Heckman considers how domestic technologies that free people to enjoy leisure time in the home have come to be understood as necessary parts of everyday life.\n\nHeckman\u2019s narrative stretches from the early-twentieth-century introduction into the home of electric appliances and industrial time-management techniques, through the postwar advent of television and the space-age \u201chouse of tomorrow,\u201d to the contemporary automated, networked \u201csmart home.\u201d He considers all these developments in relation to lifestyle and consumer narratives. Building on the tension between agency and control within the walls of homes designed to anticipate and fulfill desires, Heckman engages debates about lifestyle, posthumanism, and rights under the destabilizing influences of consumer technologies, and he considers the utopian and dystopian potential of new media forms. Heckman argues that the achievement of an environment completely attuned to its inhabitants\u2019 specific wants and needs\u2014what he calls the \u201cPerfect Day\u201d\u2014institutionalizes everyday life as the ultimate consumer practice.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "113448638", "name": "D.
