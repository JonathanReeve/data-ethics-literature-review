One concern is that students sometimes indiscriminately forward misinformation. Understanding the reasons behind misinformation sharing would help the development of IL intervention strategies. Guided by the Uses and Gratifications approach and rumor research, undergraduate and graduate students in Singapore were surveyed on why they share misinformation on social media. Gender and study-level differences were investigated. Over 60% of respondents had shared misinformation. The top reasons were related to the information's perceived characteristics, as well as self-expression and socializing. Accuracy and authoritativeness did not rank highly. Women had a higher prevalence of sharing and intention to share misinformation. Undergraduate and graduate students differed in their reasons for sharing misinformation. The former share (and intend to share) more misinformation than the latter, but the difference was not statistically significant. Because many of the reasons cited were social in nature, IL training should address the social motivations propelling such behavior. Social media systems may also develop features that encourage users to flag debunked postings and allow a correction to be displayed alongside the misinformation.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 112, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46772208", "name": "Xinran Chen"}, {"authorId": "34643417", "name": "Sei-Ching Joanna Sin"}, {"authorId": "6086997", "name": "Y.

It is often observed that news stories are first broken in Twitter space and then the electronic and print media take them up. However, the distributed structure and lack of moderation in Twitter compounded with the temptation of posting a news worthy story early on Twitter, makes the veracity of information (tweet) a major issue. Our work is an attempt to solve this problem by providing a approach to detect misinformation/rumors on Twitter in real-time automatically. We define a rumor as any information which is circulating in Twitter space and is not in agreement with the information from a credible source. For establishing credibility, our approach is based on the premise that verified News Channel accounts on Twitter would furnish more credible information as compared to the naive unverified account of user (public at large). Our approach has four key steps. Firstly, we extract live streaming tweets corresponding to Twitter trends, identify topics being talked about in each trend based on clustering using hashtags and then collect tweets for each topic. Secondly, we segregate the tweets for each topic based on whether its tweeter is a verified news channel or a general user. Thirdly, we calculate and compare the contextual and sentiment mismatch between tweets comprising of the same topic from verified Twitter accounts of News Channels and other unverified (general) users using semantic and sentiment analysis of the tweets. Lastly, we label the topic as a rumor based on the value of mismatch ratio, which reflects the degree of discrepancy between the news and public on that topic. Results show that a large amount of topics can be flagged as suspicious using this approach without involvement of any manual inspection. In order to validate our proposed algorithm, we implement a prototype called The Twitter Grapevine which targets rumor detection in the Indian domain. The prototype shows how a user can leverage this implementation to monitor the detected rumors using activity timeline, maps and tweet feed. User can also report the rumor as incorrect which can then be updated after manual inspection.", "venue": "2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 7, "citationCount": 38, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2116282944", "name": "Suchita Jain"}, {"authorId": "3363979", "name": "Vanya Sharma"}, {"authorId": "40339392", "name": "Rishabh Kaushal"}]}}, {"intents": ["background"], "contexts": ["\u2026and to find the former more convincing than the latter (Flynn et al., 2017); and emphasizing accuracy motivation, which, occurs when individuals expend more effort on issue-related reasoning, attend to relevant information more carefully, and process it more deeply (Kahne and Bowyer, 2017).", "Sticking with the example of politics, one recent study found that directional motivation was highest among those with the most political knowledge, and that greater knowledge did not increase the likelihood of rating as inaccurate posts containing misinformation (Kahne and Bowyer, 2017).", ", 2017); and emphasizing accuracy motivation, which, occurs when individuals expend more effort on issue-related reasoning, attend to relevant information more carefully, and process it more deeply (Kahne and Bowyer, 2017).", "Altogether, these findings call into question key assumptions about politics (Flynn et al., 2017; Nyhan and Reifler, 2012), education (Kahne and Bowyer, 2017), and, arguably, librarianship.", "Worse still, those most confident in their beliefs tend to be most susceptible to the backfire effect and increased polarization (Kahne and Bowyer, 2017; Nyhan and Reifler, 2010).", ", 2017; Nyhan and Reifler, 2012), education (Kahne and Bowyer, 2017), and, arguably, librarianship."], "isInfluential": true, "citedPaper": {"paperId": "a0b9c4977f12daa7af4407604bfb0fa2e9d78a28", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2552472551", "DOI": "10.3102/0002831216679817"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a0b9c4977f12daa7af4407604bfb0fa2e9d78a28", "title": "Educating for Democracy in a Partisan Age", "abstract": "This article investigates youth judgments of the accuracy of truth claims tied to controversial public issues.

In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread.

In this chapter, I explain why this is so, and I argue that this situation is serious enough to call for special ethical reflection. I suggest that there are two strategies for coming to terms with this problem. The first is to develop a critical attitude in the persons who use the Internet and to show them ways of critically assessing the quality of the information on the Internet.

Motivated reasoning is advanced as the explanation, arguing that people are psychologically motivated to maintain and support existing evaluations. Yet it seems unlikely that voters do this ad infinitum. To do so would suggest continued motivated reasoning even in the face of extensive disconfirming information. In this study we consider whether motivated reasoning processes can be overcome simply by continuing to encounter information incongruent with expectations. If so, voters must reach a tipping point after which they begin more accurately updating their evaluations. We show experimental evidence that such an affective tipping point does in fact exist. We also show that as this tipping point is reached, anxiety increases, suggesting that the mechanism that generates the tipping point and leads to more accurate updating may be related to the theory of affective intelligence.

Upon verification, users can also turn into non-believers and spread the same attitude with a mechanism analogous to that of the hoax-spreaders. Both believers and non-believers, as time passes, can return to a susceptible state. Our model is characterized by four parameters: spreading rate, gullibility, probability to verify a hoax, and that to forget one's current belief. Simulations on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and real networks for a wide range of parameters values reveal a threshold for the fact-checking probability that guarantees the complete removal of the hoax from the network.

This paper surveys the various analyses of this concept that have been proposed by information scientists and philosophers (most notably, Luciano Floridi). It argues that these analyses are either too broad (that is, that they include things that are not disinformation), or too narrow (they exclude things that are disinformation), or both. Indeed, several of these analyses exclude important forms of disinformation, such as true disinformation, visual disinformation, side-effect disinformation, and adaptive disinformation. After considering the shortcomings of these analyses, the paper argues that disinformation is misleading information that has the function of misleading.
