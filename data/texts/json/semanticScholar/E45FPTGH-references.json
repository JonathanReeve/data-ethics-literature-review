The first involves anthropomorphizing a computational system, the second, delegating decision making to a computational system, and the third, delegating instruction to a computational system. Throughout this discussion, we provide alternative design goals and methods by which responsible computing can be enhanced as a shared vision and practice within the computing community.", "venue": "J.

How do we reconcile these two standpoints--intellectually, morally, and practically? To what extent are they irreconcilable and to what extent can they be integrated? Thomas Nagel's ambitious and lively book tackles this fundamental issue, arguing that our divided nature is the root of a whole range of philosophical problems, touching, as it does, every aspect of human life. He deals with its manifestations in such fields of philosophy as: the mind-body problem, personal identity, knowledge and skepticism, thought and reality, free will, ethics, the relation between moral and other values, the meaning of life, and death. Excessive objectification has been a malady of recent analytic philosophy, claims Nagel, it has led to implausible forms of reductionism in the philosophy of mind and elsewhere. The solution is not to inhibit the objectifying impulse, but to insist that it learn to live alongside the internal perspectives that cannot be either discarded or objectified.

The tacitly ac cepted opinion was that a study of the topic would form no part of the fundamental work of ethics; an d since this opinion was apparently shared by philosophers such as Kant, Mill, G. E. Moore, W. D. R oss, and H. A. Prichard, from whom contemporary moral philosophy has mostly been derived , p rhaps the neglect was not so surprising after all. However that may be, things have recen tly been changing. During the past ten or fifteen years several philosophers have turned their atte ntion to the subject; notably G. H. von Wright and Peter Geach. Von Wright devoted a not at all perfun ctory chapter to the virtues in his bookThe Varieties of Goodness 1 published in 1963, and Peter Geach\u2019s book called The Virtues2 appeared in 1977. Meanwhile a number of interesting article s on the topic have come out in the journals. In spite of this recent work, it is best when considering the v irtues and vices to go back to Aristotle and Aquinas. I myself have found Plato less helpfu l, because the individual virtues and vices are not so clearly or consistently distinguished i n his work. It is certain, in any case, that the most systematic account is found in Aristotle, and i n the blending of Aristotelian and Christian philosophy found in St. Thomas. By and large Aquin as followed Aristotle \u2014 sometimes even heroically \u2014 where Aristotle gave an opinion, and where St. Thomas is on his own, as in developing the doctrine of the theological virtues of faith , hope and charity, and in his theocentric doctrine of happiness, he still uses an Aristotelian framew ork where he can: as for instance in speaking of happiness as man\u2019s last end. However, there are d ifferent emphases and new elements in Aquinas\u2019s ethics: often he works things out in far more det ail than Aristotle did, and it is possible to learn a great deal from Aquinas that one could not have got f rom Aristotle. It is my opinion that the Summa Theologicais one of the best sources we have for moral philosophy, and mo reover that St. Thomas\u2019s ethical writings are as useful to the athei s as to the Catholic or other Christian believer. There is, however, one minor obstacle to be overcome when one g es back to Aristotle and Aquinas for help in constructing a theory of virtues, namely a lack of coincidence between their terminology and our own. For when we talk about the virtues we are not taking as our subject everything to which Aristotle gave the name aret\u0304eor Aquinasvirtus, and consequently not everything called a virtue in translations of these authors. \u2018The virtu es\u2019 to us are the moral virtues whereas aret\u0304eandvirtus refer also to arts, and even to excellences of the speculativ e in ellect whose domain is theory rather than practice. And to make things more confu si g we find some dispositions called moral virtues in translations from the Greek and Latin, alth ough the class of virtues that Aristotle callsaretai \u0113thikai and Aquinasvirtutes moralesdoes not exactly correspond with our class of moral virtues. For us there are four cardinal moral virtue s: courage, temperance, wisdom and justice.

Many computer scientists, in fields such as human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and information systems, who had not previously been concerned with the design of libraries became keenly interested in this research opportunity. Imaginative entrepreneurial computer scientists and information scientists soon began organizing research conferences on digital libraries, and a new field was soon born. The example of digital libraries is but one example where a coalition of research agencies (or even a single agency) effectively initiates new fields and even names them. In 1997, there were several sustained discussions within the NSF about organizing research around new field labels--\"human centered systems\" and \"knowledge and distributed intelligence.\" Terms like these emerge from informal discussions between research program directors and members of the research communities whom they fund. Sometimes the terms have significant intellectual or institutional histories while sometime they are neologisms. It is common for the NSF to try to flash out meaningful research agendas for such new fields by organizing workshops of scientists with relevant interests. The following article is a portion of a report that was part of these efforts. The Committee on Computing, Information, and Communication of the National Science and Technology Council identified five components for a High Performance Computing Program, and referred to one of them as \"HumanCentered Systems.\" HCI specialists, Prof. Jim Flanagan of Rutgers and Prof. Tom Huang of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign were invited by program directors of NSF's Division on Information, Robotics and Intelligent Systems to organize a research workshop in February 1997. The label for the new field was called Human Centered Computing, Human Centered Systems, and Human Centered Intelligent Systems in the various stages of planning. A steering committee of 13 members (including Rob Kling and Leigh Star) met in November 1996 and developed some key themes and structures for the February workshop. There were to be a number of invited speakers and four thematic groups; each group would produce a section of the final report. One group, led by us, focussed on the organizational and social analysis computerization (called organizational and social informatics and described in much more detail at ht tp:/ / www.slis.indiana.edu/SI). Its members included Sara Kiesler, Phil Agre, Geoffrey Bowker, Paul Attewell, and Celestine Ntuen. Phil Agre played an important role in moderating the groups' meetings. The term \"human centered automation,\" which is one of the intellectual roots of the term \"Human Centered Systems,\" has been advanced within the field of human factors to refer to system that are (1) based on an analysis of the human tasks that the system is aiding (2) monitored for performance in terms of human benefits (3) built to take account of human skills and (4) adaptable easily to changing human needs. This conception emphasizes specialized technologies with human operators, including aircraft, advanced weapons systems, telemedical systems, and various kinds of control rooms. The organizational and social informatics group saw the value of a concept, such as human-centered systems in a broader perspective and ways to conceptualize the term were a major part of our deliberations and a key part of our report.

Finally, I suggest the implications of the analysis presented in the paper for the politics of CSCW systems design. \n \nNo idea is more provocative in controversies about technology and society than the notion that technical things have political qualities.

Winner 1986, p. 19. \n \nBy teaching people an ontology of linguistic action, grounded in simple, universal distinctions such as those of requesting and promising, we find that they become more aware of these distinctions in their everyday work and life situations. They can simplify their dealings with others, reduce time and effort spent in conversations that do not result in action, and generally manage actions in a less panicked, confused atmosphere. Flores et al 1988, p. 158. \n \nThe world has always been in the middle of things, in unruly and practical conversation, full of action and structured by a startling array of actants and of networking and unequal collectives ... The shape of my amodern history will have a different geometry, not of progress, but of permanent and multi-patterned interaction through which lives and worlds get built, human and unhuman.

For Kant, moral action consists of dutiful adherence to formal rules and has nothing to do with the pursuit of personal goals. Indeed, one can be sure that one's action is moral only if it is done out of duty and goes against all of one's \u201cinclinations.\u201d Some contemporary moral developmentalists (for instance, Kohlberg and Turiel) areformalists:they draw from Kant the conception of moral rules as universalizable categorical imperatives, recognizable by their formal features, that pertain to social issues. Others (e.g., Eisenberg) arealtruists:they draw on Kant's insistence that moral action is inherently self-sacrificial, though they also insist that moral acts be specifically motivated by the desire to benefit others. We subject both formalism and altruism to thorough critique. Both positions define the moral domain too narrowly, leaving out questions of private morality like being honest with oneself; they cannot accommodate other principled conceptions of morality, like eudaimonism, that reject their Kantian presuppositions; and they cannot answer the question \u201cWhy be moral?\u201d Whether impersonal or anti-personal, they neglect the personal. We propose a character-based redefinition of the moral domain that reintegrates moral development with the development of the self and of values, taking advantage of the insights into these areas of development afforded by the interactivist framework. We conclude by describing the challenges that a truly adequate account of moral development will have to meet and the contributions that eudaimonism can make to meeting those challenges.", "venue": "", "year": 1996, "referenceCount": 114, "citationCount": 101, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144024809", "name": "R.

In this essay I will discuss what makes computers different from other technology and how this difference makes a difference in ethical considerations. In particular, I want to characterize computer ethics and show why this emerging field is both intellectually interesting and enormously important. On my view, computer ethics is the analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology and the corresponding formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of such technology. I use the phrase \u201ccomputer technology\u201d because I take the subject matter of the field broadly to include computers and associated technology. For instance, I include concerns about software as well as hardware and concerns about networks connecting computers as well as computers themselves. A typical problem in computer ethics arises because there is a policy vacuum about how computer technology should be used. Computers provide us with new capabilities and these in turn give us new choices for action. Often, either no policies for conduct in these situations exist or existing policies seem inadequate. A central task of computer ethics is to determine what we should do in such cases, i.e., to formulate policies to guide our actions. Of course, some ethical situations confront us as individuals and some as a society. Computer ethics includes consideration of both personal and social policies for the ethical use of computer technology. Now it may seem that all that needs to be done is the mechanical application of an ethical theory to generate the appropriate policy. But this is usually not possible. A difficulty is that along with a policy vacuum there is often a conceptual vacuum. Although a problem in computer ethics may seem clear initially, a little reflection reveals a conceptual muddle. What is needed in such cases is an analysis which provides a coherent conceptual framework within which to formulate a policy for action. Indeed, much of the important work in computer ethics is devoted to proposing conceptual frameworks for understanding ethical problems involving computer technology. An example may help to clarify the kind of conceptual work that is required. Let\u2019s suppose we are trying to formulate a policy for protecting computer programs. Initially, the idea may seem clear enough. We are looking for a policy for protecting a kind of intellectual property.

Computers, both on the desktop and embedded in automobiles, appliances, cellular phones, and satellite dishes have become part of the fabric of our work and social lives. In three decades, the Internet has grown from a network connecting four American universities and research labs to a global communications network. The evolving roles and increasing importance of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic commerce, digital libraries, and computer-mediated distance education are all examples of phenomena that both rely on computing and are becoming commonplace. How are ICTs changing the ways in which we work and play? What are the effects of the increasing routinization of ICTs in modern societies? What are the practical and conceptual issues and implications of widespread and pervasive computerization? In this paper, we provide an overview of the intellectual geography of the research and theorizing in social informatics, focusing on issues applicable to the information sciences. We use the term intellectual geography to mean the physical location of those who conduct social informatics (SI) research. We use the term information sciences to mean the combination of traditional information science domains and related information systems and user behavior literatures. This overview unfolds in three parts. In the first part, we define and discuss concepts central to social informatics. In part two, we highlight the emerging intellectual geography of social informatics in the information sciences. In part three, we outline some conceptual and applied contributions that arise from this work. What is Social Informatics? Social informatics (SI) is a multi-disciplinary perspective. Social informatics researchers focus on the social consequences of the design, implementation, and use of ICTs over a wide range of social and organizational settings. Of particular interest are the roles of ICTs in social and organizational change. Researchers have studied social aspects of computerization for over 25 years, using terms such as the \"social analysis of computing,\" the \"social impacts of computing,\" \"information policy,\" \"computers and society,\" and, more recently, \"computer-mediated communication\" (Kling, 1999; p. 1; Bishop & Star, 1996: p. 309). Because the research findings and insights are found in many different literatures, they are difficult for scholars and teachers to access (Kling, Rosenbaum, Sawyer, Weisband, & Crawford, forthcoming, p. 12). Organizational informatics (OI) refers to those social informatics analyses bounded within organizations--where the primary participants are located within identifiable organizations. Many contemporary studies of the roles of computerization in shaping work and organizational structures fit within organizational informatics. For convenience, in the rest of this paper social informatics is used to denote both social and organizational informatics. Thus, both organizational and social informatics research respond directly to Bates' (1999, p. 1042) second \"big question\" that defines information science: \"How do people relate to, seek, and use information?\" What is novel about the recent interest in social informatics is that it reflects an underlying move to consolidate these disparate streams of research into a more unified and accessible domain. Then what is social informatics? According to Kling (1999), A serviceable working conception of 'social informatics' is that it identifies a body of research that examines the social aspects of computerization. A more formal definition is 'the interdisciplinary study of the design, uses and consequences of information technologies that takes into account their interaction with institutional and cultural contexts. \u2026", "venue": "Informing Sci.

Technical experts in security warn that the vast networked information system (the network of networks that includes local private systems in addition to public systems like the Internet, the Web, Cyberspace ) is vulnerable to technical failure as well as malicious attack. To induce users to trust the system we must build strong mechanisms of security to create \u00abtrusted\u00bb, or rather, trustworthy systems that overcome both types of vulnerabilities. Proponents of e-commerce, spurred by an interest in sustaining active commerce online, advocate in favor of technology and practices that would induce consumers to trust providers of goods and services, would induce providers to trust consumers, and in general, would create a general climate of trust online. Consumers must not be fearful that they will be cheated, defrauded, have their credit card numbers stolen, or receive poor quality goods; providers must not be fearful that people will fail to pay, or repudiate their commitments.

Handshaking demonstrated the absence of weapons. Clinking of glasses evolved from pouring wine back and forth to prove it was not poisoned. Now, new social traditions are needed to enhance cooperative behaviors in electronic environments supporting e-commerce, e-services, and online communities. Since users of online systems can\u2019t savor a cup of tea with an electronic rug merchant, designers must develop strategies for facilitating e-commerce and auctions. Since users can\u2019t make eye contact and judge intonations with an online lawyer or physician, designers must create new social norms for professional services. Since users can\u2019t stroll through online communities encountering neighbors with their children, designers must facilitate the trust that enables collective action. In parallel, consumer groups must be vigorous in monitoring and reporting deceptions and disreputable business practices. Political scientist Eric Uslaner of the University of Maryland calls trust \u201cthe chicken soup of the social sciences. It brings us all sorts of good things\u2014from a willingness to get involved in our communities to higher rates of economic growth ... to making daily life more pleasant. Yet, like chicken soup, it appears to work somewhat mysteriously\u201d [5]. He tries to sort out the mystery by distinguishing between moral trust, or the durable optimistic view that strangers are well-intentioned, and strategic trust, or the willingness of two people to participate in a specific exchange (see Uslaner\u2019s \u201cSocial Capital and the Net\u201d in this section). Trust facilitates cooperative behavior. It is a complex term that has generated dozens of doctoral dissertations, not only in sociology and political science, but now in information systems research as well. There are enough dimensions to trust and its failures to keep scholars and philosophers busy for some time, but e-commerce, e-services, and online community designers need a guide to practical action [4]. The designer\u2019s goal is to engage users quickly and establish and preserve strategic trust under challenging situations. But for many users, strategic trust is difficult to generate, shaken easily, and once shaken extremely difficult to rebuild. Strategic trust is fragile. The extensive literature on trust offers multiple perspectives. In his politically oriented book Trust, Francis Fukuyama, a former U.S. State Department analyst, claims: \u201cTrust is the expectation that arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative behavior, based on commonly shared norms, on the part of the members of that community\u201d [2].

This dual tradeoff is between privacy and awareness, and between awareness and disturbance. Simply stated, the more information about oneself that leaves your work area, the more potential for awareness of you exists for your colleagues. Unfortunately, this also represents the greatest potential for intrusion on your privacy. Similarly, the more information that is received about the activities of colleagues, the more potential awareness we have of them. However, at the same time, the more information we receive, the greater the chance that the information will become a disturbance to our normal work. This dual tradeoff seems to be a fundamental one. However, by carefully examining awareness problems in the light of this tradeoff it is possible to devise techniques which expose new points in the design space. These new points provide different types and quantities of information so that awareness can be achieved without invading the privacy of the sender, or creating a disturbance for the receiver.

Will the GII improve access to information for all? Will it replace libraries and publishers? How can computers and information systems be made easier to use? What are the trade-offs between tailoring information systems to user communities and standardizing them to interconnect with systems designed for other communities, cultures, and languages? \nThis book takes a close look at these and other questions of technology, behavior, and policy surrounding the GII. Topics covered include the design and use of digital libraries; behavioral and institutional aspects of electronic publishing; the evolving role of libraries; the life cycle of creating, using, and seeking information; and the adoption and adaptation of information technologies. The book takes a human-centered perspective, focusing on how well the GII fits into the daily lives of the people it is supposed to benefit. \nTaking a unique holistic approach to information access, the book draws on research and practice in computer science, communications, library and information science, information policy, business, economics, law, political science, sociology, history, education, and archival and museum studies.

Preselection tasks were used with several hundred adolescents to assure a diversity of moral and nonmoral views toward electronic information. From this group, 64 adolescents (mean age, 17 years 2 months), 32 in each study, were selected for in-depth interviews, lasting approximately 2 hr. Results showed that adolescents who permitted copying computer programs (\u201ccomputer pirating\u201d) and accessing computer files (\u201ccomputer hacking\u201d) still held overall to property and privacy rights in general and applied those rights in prototypic situations (e.g., not stealing a bicycle and not reading another person's diary without permission). Several aspects of the technology contributed to adolescents' difficulty in identifying harmful or unjust consequences of computer-mediated actions. These aspects included the ways technology can easily reproduce software, distance the actor from potential victims, and allow for access without direct harm. The results also suggest that in response to a technological innovation whose conventional status is in flux, adolescents appear to draw on foundational moral considerations to a larger extent than commonly recognized.

Compared to other primates, humans have remarkably well-developed and controllable muscles around the lips and cheeks. Indeed, more of the motor cortex (particularly Broca\u2019s area) is devoted to vocalization than to any other function, in sharp contrast to every other animal, including primates. Only homo sapiens can use the tongue, cheeks, and lips, together with the teeth, to produce 14 phonemes per second [11]; even the Neanderthals, who are known for having large brains and elaborate cultural and social behaviors, could not sustain speech due to the structure of their breathing apparatus [4]. Modern humans are also exquisitely tuned for speech recognition. Infants as young as one day old show relatively greater left hemisphere electrical activity to speech sounds and relatively greater right hemisphere activity to non-speech sounds [11]; by 22 days old, infants exhibit the adult tendency for right-ear (and left-brain-hemisphere) dominance for spoken sounds (regardless of language) and left-ear (and right-brain-hemisphere) dominance for music and other sounds [11].

Each filter is considered at nine different levels of fidelity, ranging from heavily applied filter levels that mask almost all information, to lightly applied filters that reveal almost everything. We examined how well observers of several filtered video scenes extract particular awareness cues: the number of actors; their posture (moving, standing, seated); their gender; the visible objects (basic to detailed); and how available people look (their busyness, seriousness and approachability). We also examined the privacy-preserving potential of each filter level in the context of common workplace activities.

The starry heavens above and the moral law within had better be about the only things that matter to me, if there is no one I can trust in any way. Even my own Stoic virtue will surely thrive better if it evokes some trust from others, inspires some trustworthiness in them, or is approved and imitated by them.

As such services become more powerful, privacy and security issues regarding access to sensitive user data become critical. Two key software engineering challenges arise in this context:\nPolicies regarding access to data in collaborative applications have subtle complexities, and must be easily modifiable during a collaboration.\nUsers must be able to have a high degree of confidence that the implementations of these policies are correct.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework that uses an automated verification approach to ensure that such systems conform to complex policies.

Mentoring Relationships While successful people often point to the importance of mentoring relationships in their development [2], these relationships are quite sensitive to time and space constraints. Since they often arise out of informal communications, they can be hampered by a variety of incidental factors such as office locations [3], preventing people who might excel as mentors from serving in this capacity. Where the spatial organization of the workplace is not an obstacle, mentoring activities may be hampered by daily schedules and organizational surroundings.

Most people familiar with ecommerce think of it as, first, the ability of consumers to buy products and services online (an arrangement known as B2C). Alternatively, it\u2019s also the ability of businesses to interact with one another electronically (B2B) in the interests of, say, supporting the supply chain, the next step beyond electronic data interchange. Another important change the Internet has meant for commerce is that individuals have the ability to communicate with one another, independent of location (or i2i, for individual-toindividual). i2i plays a big role in e-commerce in two main scenarios: global teams inside organizations and advisor/advisee interactions from one organization to another or from an agent to a customer. Global teams. For global teams, managers can choose members from around the world, extending their reach to find the most appropriate experts for the job at hand. Many companies have gone global, assigning people from different continents, time zones, areas of expertise, even from outside the organization, to work toward a common goal. Ford Motor Co. is an example of a global organization assigning global teams to design various automobile components and produce cars for all regions, rather than different cars for different regions, as it had previously; Ford calls it \u201cvirtual collocation.\u201d Meanwhile, although a number of companies have been doing software development around the world and around the clock, such global work has become much easier in recent years thanks to the Internet. Where these companies used to work through ftp and version-control software to share the code itself, today\u2019s Netbased communication makes it easier to discuss the work, clarify misunderstandings, coordinate changes, and monitor and maintain the schedule through email, attachments, and textchat capabilities, as well as through audio and videoconferencing. Advisor/advisee relations. The Internet was originally expected to be a great medium for \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d or the elimination of people as intermediaries to sources and services. We would be able to explore enormous digital libraries without a reference librarian; access medical information before meeting a physician; view ongoing changes in the stock market, allowing us to make decisions without a broker; or secure travel arrangements without a travel agent. Although such access is widespread today, and many of us are able to work independently, people are beginning to reappear in our online interchanges. We now recognize the value these intermediaries might offer us, including counsel, guidance to the right sources of information, assessment of the quality of the sources, and customized advice, because they understand our overall goals and needs. Today, we are seeing \u201creintermediation,\u201d or the reintroduction of people to online interaction to link sources and services. Services include live chat with human advisors\u2014on-screen videoconferencing to hone the advice for the individual being served. Reintermediation via i2i affects both B2C and B2B. Trust is the principle challenge in both areas\u2014connecting teammates across long distances and the interaction of advice seekers and advisors on the Internet.
