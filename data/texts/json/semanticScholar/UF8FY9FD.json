The analysis draws from long\u2013term ethnographic research and paired interviews with key informants separated by a six\u2013year interval to identify and explain different trajectories of changing use of the Internet over time. Changes in use followed one of three general patterns: (1) intensification, (2) reorientation, or (3) discontinuance. These changes were linked to the life circumstances of individual users, their immediate social context of use, as well as broader societal shifts in the perception of the Internet in Ghana. This article critiques an implicit theory of technology in society in socio\u2013economic development work targeting low\u2013income countries like Ghana by showing how assessments of technology\u2019s efficacy by users are culturally shaped and prone to change over time.", "venue": "First Monday", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48129731", "name": "J.
