I describe research on faculty values and needs in scholarly communication that confirm a number of conservative tendencies in publishing. These tendencies, influenced by tenure and promotion requirements, as well as disciplinary cultures, have both positive and negative consequences. Rigorous research could inform development of good practices and policies in academic publishing, as well as counter rhetoric concerning the future of peer review and scholarly communication.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 29, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145679660", "name": "D.
