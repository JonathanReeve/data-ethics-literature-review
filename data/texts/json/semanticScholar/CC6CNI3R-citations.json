In the dichotomy between describing the world using macrodata and prescribing preset behaviors after analyzing big data, algorithmic reason may give rise to closed communication systems that simplify and standardize our practices. In accordance with an essay and philosophical method that binds the form and substance of criticism together, the dimensions for a reflective theory of algorithms concern three fundamental facets: a) abstraction, mathematical encryption, and calculation; b) performative algorithm-induced passivity, and c) invisible, impersonal power. So, the major contribution of the article is the discussion of the constraints arising from algorithmic technologies. The emphasis on a critical theory of technology becomes all the more relevant as digital devices normalize as intermediaries in various fields of human activity. Therefore, it is about problematizing technology as the basis of everyday behaviors and decisions from a theoretical perspective. The article intends to continue judging technology based on authors such as those belonging to the Frankfurt School or Lewis Mumford and Jacques Ellul in the field of technology itself, as well as current digitalism critics, such as Cathy O\u2019Neil, Evgeny Morozov, or Nicholas Carr.

That project involved families of a child with disabilities and their co-creation with interactive musical media that were designed as home-environment objects (e.g. pillows, carpets, and toys). This paper examines aspects of the project results with regard to the subject-object interaction. One such aspect is that the users would experience the media as active collaborators and not \u201cjust\u201d as another technological thing which they could manipulate into a cause-and-effect reaction. Another such aspect is that successful co-creation with the media seemed to demand an open and empathic (also called dialogical) mind-set among those who took on the role of helper.

Cities stand for a substantial part of the world GDP and are often lifted as possible drivers of sustainable development. However, the city has limitations and vulnerabilities. Cities depend on resources flowing into the city and increasing populations strain their land use. Climate change threatens cities with sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme weather events. Transforming cities into Smart Sustainable Cities by incorporation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is becoming a recurring proposed solution to these limitations and challenges. The two main areas where ICT are envisioned to function for this are i) as part of the city's infrastructure for monitoring, efficiency and automatization of processes, and ii) as an enabler for sharing of both information and goods among citizens, expectedly leading to more sustainable urban lifestyles. However, there are several limits to the realisation of the Smart Sustainable City. Manufacturing, implementation and maintenance of its digital infrastructure hold environmental risks and require human and natural resources. Furthermore, there are issues of increased vulnerability of the city due to increased complexity. Already now, the (global) flows that the city depends upon to thrive, are to a large and increasing extent possible due to - and dependent on - ICTs working without disturbances. Considering the fragility of these systems, both physical and virtual, is the Smart Sustainable City a desirable or even feasible path? We suggest that while ICT may be useful for making cities more sustainable, we need to be heedful so as not to make the city even more vulnerable in the process. We suggest that we should make sure that the ICT systems simply assist the cities, while maintaining analogue backup in case the ICT shuts down; that we should build more resilient ICT systems with higher backward compatibility; and that we should acknowledge increasing complexity as a problem and strive to counteract it.", "venue": "LIMITS", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 97, "citationCount": 15, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "28013330", "name": "Tina Ringenson"}, {"authorId": "5003077", "name": "Elina Eriksson"}, {"authorId": "3046504", "name": "Miriam B\u00f6rjesson Rivera"}, {"authorId": "2227740", "name": "Josefin Wangel"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "2a02fe275e632013652d729409a3dd873702473f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2560459391", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-024-0878-2_9"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a02fe275e632013652d729409a3dd873702473f", "title": "Community Well-Being and Information Technology", "abstract": "The chapter is based upon how information and communications technologies (ICT) can help enhance the well-being of communities by promoting societal quality which we analyse as: socio-economic security, social cohesion, social inclusion and social empowerment.

We pinpoint it as an \"instrumental\" form of social interaction (i.e. mediated by machines), a notion that appears useful for the sake of possible preclinical modeling. The features of Internet use reveals as addictive when this comes at the expense of genuine real-life sociability, with an overlap towards the hikikomori phenomenon (i.e., extreme retreat to one's own room). Due to the specific neuro-developmental plasticity in adolescence, IA poses risks to youths' mental health, and may likely produce negative consequences in everyday life. The thwarted development of adolescents' identity, self-image and adaptive social relationships is discussed: the IA adolescents often suffer loss of control, feelings of anger, symptoms of distress, social withdrawal, and familial conflicts. Further, more severe clinical conditions are also associated to IA, such as dysthymic, bipolar, affective, social-anxiety disorders, as well as major depression. This paper overviews the literature on IA, from neuro-biological, psycho-social and clinical standpoints, taking into account recent debates on diagnostic criteria, nosographic label and assessment tools.

Forty percent of the world population use the Internet, whereas six times more individuals are online today compared to the last decade (International Telecommunication Union, 2012, 2013). Advancements in digital technologies have resulted in various positive applications, including (but not limited to) promoting (mental) health, education, leisure, communication and global connectivity. However, extensive research conducted over the last two decades also evidenced that the use of digital technologies may come at a price, and accumulating evidence resulting from empirical research emphasized that a number of negative consequences are linked to the overuse of these technologies, such as subjective distress and psychopathological symptoms, health problems, professional and social disruptions, symptoms traditionally associated with substance-related addictions (see Billieux, Maurage, Lopez-Fernandez, Kuss, & Griffiths, 2015; Kuss, Griffiths, Karila, & Billieux, 2014, for reviews). Accordingly, technological innovations of the 21st Century have not only brought about significant lifestyle changes which some critically refer to as leading to us being \u201calone together\u201d (i.e., brought together virtually by technology, but physically alone due to overengagement with technology) (Turkle, 2013), and in some instances may lead to the development of addictive usage patterns. Initial publications on the topic, which often took the form of clinical case description or theoretical papers (Griffiths, 1996; Young, 1996), largely assumed that deregulated use of digital technologies should be considered as a \u201cbehavioural\u201d or \u201cnon-chemical\u201d addiction (Marks, 1990), based on their similarities with substance-related addictions, including cognitive salience, mood modification, tolerance and withdrawal-like manifestations, conflict, and relapse (Griffiths, 2005). Various terms emerged in the literature to describe pathological use of digital technologies, such as \u201cInternet addiction\u201d (Young, 1998), \u201ccompulsive Internet use\u201d (Greenfield, 1999), or \u201cmobile phone addiction\u201d (Ch\u00f3liz, 2010). It has also been proposed that these various disorders could fall within the remit of technological addictions, which have been defined as \u201cnon-chemical behavioural addictions which involve human-machine interaction\u201d, and includes both passive and active behaviours which are maintained via reinforcing characteristics and may lead to the development of an addiction (Griffiths, 1995, p. 15). Over the course of the last 20 years, a myriad of empirical studies has been published suggesting Internet use-related disorders can be considered addictive behaviours, including research on the development of diagnostic criteria (Tao et al., 2010) and screening instruments (Lortie & Guitton, 2013), (2) epidemiology (Kuss, Griffiths, et al., 2014a), neurobiology (D'Hondt, Billieux, & Maurage, 2015; Kuss & Griffiths, 2012) and psycho(patho)logical correlates (Kuss & Lopez-Fernandez, 2016),", "venue": "Addictive behaviors", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 52, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2034264", "name": "D.

To guide this process, we propose using a self-reflexive critical practice based on autoethnography as a tool to reflect and construct knowledge out of our subjective experience of designers involved in PD. Grounded on our experience of PD with teenagers, we report how autoethnography allowed gaining a deeper understanding of one\u2019s own positions, assumptions and contradictions on aspects related to our standpoint on participatory practices, the images that we have of participants and our role in the design process. This awareness allowed taking into account emotions, personal stories and values in ethical choices, hence guiding situated decision-making on ethical and methodological aspects.

Building on Dodge and Kitchin\u2019s \u2018code/space,\u2019 we highlight how studies of technology in geography are already concerned with questions of sexuality through the examination of biopolitics and the regulation of bodies, together with the (re-)establishment of new and old lines between the public and the private. The immanence of sexuality in code/space foregrounds the importance of spatial processes characterised by their difference and normativity in the geographies of technology. Queer geographies critically examine such different experiences and processes of differentiation through space in their nuanced conceptualisations of spatial regulation and transgression. We illustrate how these two bodies of geographical scholarship might be synthesised by outlining three approaches for studies of \u2018queer code/space.\u2019 To show how there are a variety of relationships between sexuality, code, and space, we play on the double entendre of \u2018code\u2019 as a set of social rules and norms, and \u2018code\u2019 as the set of algorithmic instructions underlying software systems. In both senses, codes constrain forms of intimate life, but can also transgress, disrupt, and distribute the norm.

In addition, there have been few studies that verified the moderating role of social capital in the relationship between SNS use and psychosocial factors. Using the one-year longitudinal panel data of 477 subjects, the current study tested the effects of SNS use and network size on psychosocial well-being factors (i.e., depression, loneliness, and life satisfaction). To clarify the accumulative effects of the variables on one another, the concept of reciprocal influences was also applied in the analysis. The results show different results of SNS use according to the degree of social capital. For the lower-social-capital group, a vicious circle was observed: depression augmented SNS use, but the increase of SNS use reinforced the degree of depression. Conversely, for the higher-social-capital group, a virtuous circle was found: SNS use increased the network size, and the increased network size strengthened the degree of life satisfaction.

Code is at the heart of this technology. The way code is perceived influences the way our everyday interaction with digital technologies is perceived: is it an objective exchange of ones and zeros, or a value- laden power struggle between white male programmers and those who think they are users, when they are, in fact, the product being sold. Understanding the nature of code thus enables the imagination and exploration of the present state and alternative future developments of digital technologies. A wider imagination is especially important for developing basic education so that it provides the capabilities for coping with these developments. Currently, the discussion has been mainly on the technical details of code. We study how to broaden this narrow view in order to support the design of more comprehensive and future-proof education around code and coding. We approach the concept of code through nine different metaphors from the existing literature on systems thinking and organisational studies. The metaphors we use are machine, organism, brain, flux and transformation, culture, political system, psychic prison, instrument of domination and carnival. We describe their epistemological backgrounds and give examples of how code is perceived through each of them. We then use the metaphors in order to suggest different complementary ways that ICT could be taught in schools.

However, research remains largely silent on which side dominates in driving SNS use. To address this gap and to better understand the nature of SNSs we examine the positive and negative drivers of SNS use in parallel. We draw on the uses and gratifications theory and place social enhancement and interpersonal connectivity as the socio-psychologically positive gratifications and exhibitionism and voyeurism as the adverse gratifications predicting SNS use. We further link these gratifications to two key psychological needs, namely self-presentation and the need to belong. We conceptualize our dependent variable, SNS use, as a multi-dimensional second-order construct that consists of content production, content consumption, amount of usage, and comprehensiveness of one's profile information. We use longitudinal data from Facebook users to test our research model. The results show that exhibitionism, voyeurism and interpersonal connectivity predict SNS use. Furthermore, the number of friends in the SNS decreases the effect of exhibitionism and increases the effect of social enhancement. Altogether, the role of exhibitionism and voyeurism in predicting SNS use underscores the need for increased awareness of the socio-psychologically dark side of SNSs. We investigate the two sides of self-presentation and need to belong in SNSs.We examine positive and negative predictors of SNS use in parallel.Voyeurism, exhibitionism, and social enhancement predict SNS use.Narcissistic self-promotion, i.e. exhibitionism is the main driver of SNS use.", "venue": "Comput.

After item development involving focus groups with young adults and content validity analysis from attachment experts, a preliminary version of the YAPS was administered to 955 participants ages 1829. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 2-dimension structure: Refuge, characterized by feeling safe with the phone and uncomfortable upon separation; and Burden, characterized by relief upon separation from the phone and the perception that it diminishes enjoyment of a given moment. Findings reflect the strong psychometric properties of the YAPS, including reliability, factorial validity and criterion validity with relevant constructs.

In this poem, Attar argues that the wayfarer must traverse seven valleys to achieve perfection.

We evaluate the ITP in one user study with adults and one with children. We compare players\u2019 reported experiences when playing both traditional and interactive tag. Players report significantly higher engagement and immersion when playing interactive tag. We also use tracking data collected automatically to quantitatively analyze player behavior in both tag games.

Contemporary approaches in support of doing so centers around a relational appearance based approach, which takes departure in the fact that we already by now enter into ethical demanding relations with (even simplistic) robots as if they had a mind of their own. Hence, it is assumed that moral status can be viewed as socially constructed and negotiated within relations. However, I argue that a relational turn risks turning the as if into if at the cost of losing sight of what matters in human-human relations. Therefore, I stick to a human centered framework and introduce a moral philosophical perspective, primarily based on Kant's Tugendlehre and his conception of duties as well as the Formula of Humanity, which also holds a relational perspective.

To this aim, we carried out an experimental study with pre- and post-questionnaires with 79 participants during a robotic event: the RoboParty?. Results show that building and programming a robot fosters a more nuanced judgment about robots' belonging to the living and non-living categories but, on the other side, a more definite judgment about the educative functions that a robot may serve. Thus, at this stage of technology development in contemporary society, robots seem to share something with living entities and some other things with non-living ones. Just like living entities, robots hold an ontological status that admits degrees; similarly to non-living entities, robots need to have a precise function in order for users to have a meaningful interaction with them.

It uses a qualitative approach to explore different aspects of the everyday lives of adolescents, such as sociability, leisure time and family use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), in order to assess the impact of the Connecting Equality Program (Programa Conectar Igualdad, PCI) on reducing digital inequalities and fostering social inclusion. In particular, the paper explores what were the existing conditions of access for students and their families when the PCI was first implemented? What influence does the implementation of the PCI have on the individual, family and scholastic appropriation of ICTs? How does the use of computers and the Internet vary among youth? Has this large\u2010scale incorporation of netbooks in schools, and especially homes and free time changed it in any way? Does the appropriation of ICTs through student participation in the PCI contribute to material and symbolic social inclusion? To answer these questions, we compare the processes of ICT appropriation among lower and middle class adolescents, focusing on the distinctive uses and meanings assigned to computers and the Internet by boys and girls in their daily lives.

This paper attempts to revisit these explanations by reflecting on a decade long of studies conducted in one Virtual Reality Laboratory aimed at better understanding the correlation between technology-more specifically, 3D Immersive Virtual Reality (3D IVR)-and the accelerated improvement in a variety of cognitive skills. These studies tested a few aspects of Flynn's social and cultural explanations. We examined, first, whether it is possible to generate an even greater acceleration in the enhancement of various abstract thinking skills. We asked whether it is possible to improve skills even among populations with congenital cognitive disabilities, and what is the most efficient way to accelerate the improvement. And most importantly-we examined whether it is possible to improve concrete thinking skills as well, which Flynn found not to have improved. The results of these studies cast solid doubt on Flynn's explanations, suggesting that advanced educational technologies, with their advanced interfaces, indeed generate an accelerated enhancement in a wide range of skills that the natural environment alone cannot account for.

The present research argues that engagement with online discussion forums can have underappreciated benefits for users' well-being and engagement in offline civic action, and that identification with other online forum users plays a key role in this regard. Users of a variety of online discussion forums participated in this study. We hypothesized and found that participants who felt their expectations had been exceeded by the forum reported higher levels of forum identification. Identification, in turn, predicted their satisfaction with life and involvement in offline civic activities.

We show that cyberasociality is neither a mere reflection of offline sociability nor a proxy for other well-studied traits such as extraversion or neuroticism, nor a simple reflection of Internet experience or cohort effects. We find that cyberasociality impacts how people use digital social tools more than whether they use them, and that the cyberasocial are less likely to use platforms for digitally mediated social interaction to broaden their social networks or to forge new social ties online while they are equally likely to use digital channels for utilitarian purposes such as coordinating plans or finding out about class assignments.

This research study sought to contribute to the nomophobia research literature by identifying and describing the dimensions of nomophobia and developing a questionnaire to measure nomophobia. Consequently, this study adopted a two-phase, exploratory sequential mixed methods design. The first phase was a qualitative exploration of nomophobia through semi-structured interviews conducted with nine undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university in the U.S. The qualitative findings from this initial exploration were then developed into a questionnaire measuring nomophobia. In the second phase of the study, the nomophobia questionnaire (NMP-Q) was tested with a large sample of 301 undergraduate students. As a result of the first, qualitative phase of the study, four dimensions of nomophobia were identified, namely not being able to communicate, losing connectedness, not being able to access information and giving up convenience. Using the findings from this phase, a 20item NMP-Q was created. The results of the second, quantitative phase showed that the four dimensions were connected to the theoretical construct of nomophobia and that the NMP-Q produced valid and reliable scores. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative approaches, this study provided greater insight into nomophobia as a theoretical construct.

Though we will examine several types of design features and their potential effects on children, the unifying theme of our exploration will be our focus on the impact of child-robot interaction (CRI) on children\u2019s development and their future welfare. To a large degree, we will analyse how encoding robots with a particular type of \u2018personality\u2019 may affect the emotional development of children. We will integrate into our discussion commonly embraced ethical principles such as beneficence and nonmaleficence; our discussion is also influenced by elements of the capabilities approach as articulated by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen. Robots designed to serve as companions for children can range from rather simple devices that a child can use as a toy during playtime, such as My Keepon, to those that can engage in conversation or other relatively sophisticated activities. Included at the latter end of this spectrum is Kismet, a robot with an expressive voice and face that encourages interaction with humans and is capable of learning through this interaction. Embedded in the term \u2018companion\u2019 is the notion that at least some portion of a child\u2019s, or other user\u2019s, care will be entrusted to the robot.

Il paper presenta parte dei risultati di una ricerca esplorativa volta a indagare tutte le dimensioni caratterizzanti questo sentimento e ha per oggetto i tweet postati tra luglio e dicembre 2012 con hashtag semanticamente afferenti al tema della vergogna. I risultati hanno permesso di ricostruire una mappa delle caratteristiche narrative di questa pratica di socializzazione emotiva digitale, sulla base dei processi di appropriazione del meta-medium (De Carli, 1997) e di colonizzazione di un preciso contesto partecipativo e mediato. La Rete, dunque, come rifugio dal rossore del contesto situato e al contempo spazio ed occasione di situazioni imbarazzanti che mettono in crisi le nuove forme di pudore digitale. One of the most common use of the Net is to share narratives about the Everyday life. This continue translation in words and images of personal experiences is a part of the appropriation process of mobile and digital devices. It is also the expression of the new way of living and using the Net, considered, more and more, a crowded, participated and emotionally thick context. The paper aims at underlining some narrative practices emerging from the sharing of emotive experiences. More specifically the focus is oriented toward shame and embarrassment, that are emotions typically situated, linked with a specific context. In the case of digital environments, we can observe the translation of this livings in narrative fragments that are shared with personal contacts. We describe a part of the results of an explorative research about on-line shaming. The study is focused on the qualitative content analysis of tweets posted on line during July-December 2012 with hashtags semantically linked with \u201cshame\u201d. The results shows the narrative characteristics of the socialization of this family of emotions, according with the practices of appropriation of the digital devices and contexts.

In this paper, we describe CoStream, a novel system for mobile live sharing of user-generated video in-situ during events. Developed iteratively with users, CoStream goes beyond prior work by providing a strong real-time coupling to the event, leveraging users' social connections to provide multiple perspectives on the ongoing action. Field trials demonstrate that real time sharing of different perspectives on the same event has the potential to provide fundamentally new experiences of same-place events, such as concerts or stadium sports.

Sherry Turkle discusses some of the antisocial consequences that mobile phone use has had among teenagers in the U.S., critiquing networked life, a life where we become inseparable from our smartphones, where our social lives are happening online, where devices become substitutes for connecting with each other faceto-face, and where we would rather text than talk [1]. Indeed, we see some of these symptoms popping up in other places, too, such as Finland, Wales, and Chile. The truth is, we are spending an awful amount of time emailing, texting, facebooking, and tweeting in our Western world [2]. Our relationships with one another are mediated through screens, as opposed to happening directly in parks, cafes, pubs, or living rooms.
