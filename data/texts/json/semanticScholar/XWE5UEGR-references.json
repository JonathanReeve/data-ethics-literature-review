Using a large-scale field experiment, we show that it is possible to reduce conflict with a student-driven intervention. By encouraging a small set of students to take a public stance against typical forms of conflict at their school, our intervention reduced overall levels of conflict by an estimated 30%. Network analyses reveal that certain kinds of students (called \u201csocial referents\u201d) have an outsized influence over social norms and behavior at the school. The study demonstrates the power of peer influence for changing climates of conflict, and suggests which students to involve in those efforts. Theories of human behavior suggest that individuals attend to the behavior of certain people in their community to understand what is socially normative and adjust their own behavior in response. An experiment tested these theories by randomizing an anticonflict intervention across 56 schools with 24,191 students. After comprehensively measuring every school\u2019s social network, randomly selected seed groups of 20\u201332 students from randomly selected schools were assigned to an intervention that encouraged their public stance against conflict at school.

In these explanations, both disinhibition and greater equality of participation are thought to facilitate the exchange of extreme persuasive arguments, resulting in polarization. These accounts are briefly reviewed and attention is drawn to various problematic issues. We provide an alternative model and explanation based on social identity (SI) theory and a re-conceptualization of de-individuation, which takes into account the social and normative factors associated with group polarization. Predictions from both sets of explanations are explored empirically by means of an experiment manipulating the salience of the discussion group, and de-individuation operationalized as the isolation and anonymity of the participants. In this experiment we were able to partial out the effects of the CMC technology which have confounded comparisons with face-to-face interaction in previous research.

This article describes some of the issues raised by electronic communication, illustrates one empirical approach for investigating its social psychological effects, and discusses why social psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding of computer-mediated communication specifically and of computers and technological change in society more generally. One objective of our research is to explore how people participate in computer-mediated communication and how computerization affects group efforts to reach consensus. In experiments, we have shown differences in participation, decisions, and interaction among groups meeting face to face and in simultaneous computer-linked discourse and communication by electronic mail. We discuss these results and the design of subsequent research to highlight the many researchable social psychological issues raised by computing and technological change. Computer technologies are improving so swiftly these days that few of us comprehend even a small part of the change. Computers are transforming work and, in some cases, lives. Whether eager for this or resistant, many people believe the organizational, social, and personal effects of computers will be deeply felt (De Sola Poole, 1977; Hiltz & Turoff, 1978; Kling, 1980). Today, no one can predict in any detail the nature of the transformations that computers will bring, but one aspect of life that will certainly be affected is communication. The use of electronic mail and messages, long-distance blackboards, computer bulletin boards, instantaneously transferable data banks, and simultaneous computer conferences is reportedly advancing \"like an avalanche\" (Stockton, 1981; also see Kraemer, 1981). The U.S. federal judiciary, for example, is using electronic mail to speed the circulation of appellate opinion drafts among panels of judges (Weis, 1983). Computer conferences are being used for such legal proceedings as admission of evidence, trial scheduling, giving parties access to documents, and expert interrogation (Bentz & Potrykus, 1976; \"Party-Line Plea,\" 1981). Other government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, as well as private firms, such as Westinghouse Corporation and Xerox Corporation, and some universities, use computer-mediated communication extensively for both routine transfer of data and nonroutine interpersonal communication and project work (e.g., Licklider & Vezza, 1978; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1977; Wang Corporation, 1982). Computer-mediated communication was once confined to technical users and was considered somewhat arcane. This no longer holds true. Computer-mediated communication is a key component of the emerging technology of computer networks. In networks, people can exchange, store, edit, broadcast, and copy any written document. They can send data and messages instantaneously, easily, at low cost, and over long distances. Two or more people can look at a document and revise it together, consult with each other on critical matters without meeting together or setting up a telephone conference, or ask for and give assistance interactively (Hiltz & Turoff, 1978; Williams, 1977). Networks, and hence computer-mediated communications, are proliferating at a tremendous rate. In addition to the older long-distance networks that connect thousands of scientists, professionals, and managers (e.g., the Department of Defense's ARPANET, GTE's TELENET), there are more and more local-area networks that link up computers within a region, city, or organization (e.g., Nestar System's CLUSTERBUS, Xerox's ETHERNET, Ford Aerospace's FLASHNET, and Wang Laboratories' WANGNET). Stimulating this growth are the decreasing costs and the advantages of networks over stand-alone systems, such as sharing high-speed printers and access to a common interface for otherwise incompatible equipment. The future of this technology cannot be foretold, but it is far from arcane. The functions and impact of computer-mediated communication are still poorly understood. Critical information (such as who uses it for what purposes) October 1984 \u2022 American Psychologist Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Aisociation, Inc. Vol. 39, No. 10, 1123-1134 1123 is lacking, and the social psychological significance is controversial (see, e.g., Turoff, 1982). Computers could make communication easier, just as the canning of perishables and the development of can openers made food preparation easier, or they could have much more complex implications. For instance, access to electronic communication may change the flow of information within organizations, altering status relations and organizational hierarchy. When a manager can receive electronic mail from 10,000 employees, what happens to existing controls over participation and information? When people can publish and distribute their own electronic newspaper at no cost, does the distribution of power change too? When communication is rapid and purely textual, do working groups find it easier or harder to resolve conflict? These unanswered questions illustrate that, although the technology may be impressive, little systematic research exists on its psychological, social, and cultural significance. Given such conditions it seems sensible to try to understand the fundamental behavioral, social, and organizational processes that surround computer-mediated communication. We believe that ideas and approaches from social psychology and other areas of behavioral science can be applied to these questions. This article is meant to describe some of the issues raised by electronic communication; to illustrate, from our own work, one empirical approach for investigating them; and to show why social psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding of electronic communication specifically and of computers and technological change in society more generally. We begin by citing some existing research on computer-mediated communication. Most of this research addresses the technical capabilities of the electronic technologies. Next, we consider the possible social psychological impact, and we discuss some hypotheses and some possible implications for the outcomes of communication. Finally, we describe some of our own experiments on social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication, using these to indicate potential lines of future research.", "venue": "", "year": 1984, "referenceCount": 123, "citationCount": 2657, "influentialCitationCount": 76, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47198673", "name": "S.

During the past 50 years, in conjunction with many legislative changes promoting the rights of Black Americans, there have been dramatic changes in Whites' self-reported attitudes toward Blacks. Specifically, several large-scale survey studies suggest that self-reported racial attitudes have become considerably more positive (Greeley & Sheatsley, 1971; Kluegel & Smith, 1986; Schuman, Steeh, & Bobo, 1985; Taylor, Sheatsley, & Greeley, 1978). One of the persistent challenges for prejudice researchers is to understand the motivations underlying such nonprejudiced responses. Do they reflect sincere changes in personal attitudes or are they motivated by social pressure created by changes in the social milieu? In the 1990s, these changes in self-reported attitudes have culminated in a rather pervasive social norm discouraging prejudice toward Blacks in the United States (see Blanchard, Lilly, & Vaughn, 1991; Monteith, Deneen, & Tooman, 1996). This norm, embodied, for example, in \"politically correct\" (PC) standards, mandates proper speech and behavior and thereby creates social pressure to respond without prejudice (e.g., Adler et al., 1990; D'Souza, 1991). When people fail to comply with these standards, they risk disapproval and, in many cases, sanctions from others. What then are we to make of self-reported attitudes or behaviors that appear to be nonprejudiced? The presence of the rather pervasive external social pressure to respond without prejudice has created enduring dilemmas for both social perceivers and social scientists as they try to discern the motivation(s) underlying (generally socially acceptable) nonprejudiced responses.", "venue": "", "year": 1998, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount": 1345, "influentialCitationCount": 163, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145202321", "name": "E.

To the online community, the spread of offensive language undermines its reputation, drives users away, and even directly affects its growth. To users, viewing offensive language brings negative influence to their mental health, especially for children and youth. When offensive language is detected in a user message, a problem arises about how the offensive language should be removed, i.e. the offensive language filtering problem. To solve this problem, manual filtering approach is known to produce the best filtering result. However, manual filtering is costly in time and labor thus can not be widely applied. In this paper, we analyze the offensive language in text messages posted in online communities, and propose a new automatic sentence-level filtering approach that is able to semantically remove the offensive language by utilizing the grammatical relations among words. Comparing with existing automatic filtering approaches, the proposed filtering approach provides filtering results much closer to manual filtering. To demonstrate our work, we created a dataset by manually filtering over 11,000 text comments from the YouTube website. Experiments on this dataset show over 90% agreement in filtered results between the proposed approach and manual filtering approach.

Furthermore, contact effects were negligible for minority members. These effects were obtained for 2 indicators of prejudice: negative intergroup emotions and desire for social distance. For both majority and minority members, contact effects on negative emotions were stronger when outgroup contacts were perceived as being typical of their group.

These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors.

Previous research examining whether white racism hurts black candidates has yielded mixed results. Fortunately, the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama provides an opportunity to examine more rigorously whether prejudice disadvantages black candidates. I also make use of an innovation in the measurement of racial stereotypes in the 2008 American National Election Studies survey, which yields higher levels of reporting of racial stereotypes among white respondents. I find that negative stereotypes about blacks significantly eroded white support for Barack Obama. Further, racial stereotypes do not predict support for previous Democratic presidential candidates or current prominent Democrats, indicating that white voters punished Obama for his race rather than his party affiliation. Finally, prejudice had a particularly large impact on the voting decisions of Independents and a substantial impact on Democrats but very little influence on Republicans.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 69, "citationCount": 246, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "12308240", "name": "Spencer Piston"}]}}, {"contexts": ["This mechanism is best explained by the SIDE, in which the depressed sense of one\u2019s personal identity is supplanted by an increased sense of one\u2019s social identity (Reicher et al. 1995; Lea and Spears 1991)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "f9b95729e84ae2de9a7877dcbf6c861e2576693d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087391290", "DOI": "10.1080/14792779443000049"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9b95729e84ae2de9a7877dcbf6c861e2576693d", "title": "A Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Phenomena", "abstract": "This chapter challenges traditional models of deindividuation. These are based on the assumption that such factors as immersion in a group and anonymity lead to a loss of selfhood and hence of control over behaviour. We argue that such models depend upon an individualistic conception of the self, viewed as a unitary construct referring to that which makes individuals unique. This is rejected in favour of the idea that self can be defined at various different levels including the categorical self as well as the personal self. Hence a social identity model of deindividuation (SIDE) is outlined. Evidence is presented to show that deindividuation manipulations gain effect, firstly, through the ways in which they affect the salience of social identity (and hence conformity to categorical norms) and, secondly, through their effects upon strategic considerations relating to the expression of social identities. We conclude that the classic deindividuation paradigm of anonymity within a social group, far from lead...", "venue": "", "year": 1995, "referenceCount": 81, "citationCount": 916, "influentialCitationCount": 60, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6078899", "name": "S.

This study extends previous research beyond the confrontation dyad and examines evaluations of third parties who witness a biased response and its confrontation by a target or nontarget. In addition, to determine the absolute (rather than relative) effectiveness of target versus nontarget confrontations, this study included a no-confrontation control condition. White participants watched a video debate between two students in which a White speaker expressed negative race-related comments and was either confronted or not by a White or Black speaker. The nontarget's confrontation was rated as more persuasive and increased perceptions of the White speaker's level of bias, whereas the target's confrontation was rated as rude and increased participants' agreement with the initial biased response.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 115, "influentialCitationCount": 11, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "4051381", "name": "Heather M.

Meanwhile, user-level offensiveness detection seems a more feasible approach but it is an under researched area. To bridge this gap, we propose the Lexical Syntactic Feature (LSF) architecture to detect offensive content and identify potential offensive users in social media. We distinguish the contribution of pejoratives/profanities and obscenities in determining offensive content, and introduce hand-authoring syntactic rules in identifying name-calling harassments. In particular, we incorporate a user's writing style, structure and specific cyber bullying content as features to predict the user's potentiality to send out offensive content. Results from experiments showed that our LSF framework performed significantly better than existing methods in offensive content detection. It achieves precision of 98.24% and recall of 94.34% in sentence offensive detection, as well as precision of 77.9% and recall of 77.8% in user offensive detection. Meanwhile, the processing speed of LSF is approximately 10msec per sentence, suggesting the potential for effective deployment in social media.", "venue": "2012 International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount": 438, "influentialCitationCount": 44, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47558464", "name": "Ying Chen"}, {"authorId": "2110339183", "name": "Yilu Zhou"}, {"authorId": "1712616", "name": "Sencun Zhu"}, {"authorId": "46485370", "name": "Heng Xu"}]}}, {"contexts": ["2013), systematically de-mobilizing the populations who tend to be victimized (Hinduja and Patchin 2007).", "They are likely to become more anxious for their safety, more fearful of crime and less likely to express themselves publicly (Henson et al. 2013), systematically de-mobilizing the populations who tend to be victimized (Hinduja and Patchin 2007)."], "isInfluential": false, "intents": ["background"], "citedPaper": {"paperId": null, "externalIds": null, "url": null, "title": "Offline consequences of online victimization: School violence and delinquency", "abstract": null, "venue": "Journal of School Violence,", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": null, "citationCount": null, "influentialCitationCount": null, "isOpenAccess": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "S.
