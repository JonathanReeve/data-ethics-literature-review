Through a systematic study of the literature, 215 articles on social media used by individuals with disabilities were selected and 29 selected for in\u2010depth thematic analysis.

However, people with disabilities can face challenges when retrieving online information as they often use assistive technologies that might not be fully supported by web pages. Municipalities\u2019 websites are an important source of information for all citizens, regardless of their individual characteristics. To be able to support all citizens\u2019 needs, several standards provide support for web developers. One of the standards is \u201cStandard EN 301 549\u2013Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services\u201d in Europe. This study addresses the accessibility of public government services, more specifically municipalities\u2019 websites, where there are still accessibility challenges. With a systematic literature review, we found no studies that would analyze the government web pages\u2019 compliance with Standard EN 301 549. Therefore, this research had two main research goals: (1) to verify whether the websites of Slovenian municipalities were compliant with the Standard EN 301 549 in the years 2017 and 2018, and (2) to compare the results before and after the adoption of Standard EN 301 549 in Slovenia. The answers to the research questions were obtained with an accessibility evaluation of 189 Slovenian municipalities\u2019 websites. The results, based on a descriptive analysis, indicate that, in 2017, none of the evaluated websites were fully compliant with the web content requirements of Standard EN 301 549, while at the end of 2018, 62 websites (33%) were fully compliant with the aforementioned standard. Furthermore, the results from an extended statistical analysis indicate improvement in websites standard compliance in 2018, even significant improvement for some web requirements after the adoption of the standard. A secondary contribution of this research is twofold: (1) a detailed presentation of the accessibility evaluation procedure and (2) its application on a specific domain (government domain) and in a specific geographical area (Slovenia). The same procedure could be applied to other domains and other countries around Europe (or even around the world in case Standard EN 301 549 is replaced with a relevant accessibility standard that applies to the chosen area of research).", "venue": "Universal Access in the Information Society", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "152144884", "name": "K.

A heuristic method (based on J. Nielsen\u2019s heuristics) was used to evaluate 60 websites. The errors obtained were grouped into 14 categories. Each of the error groups was assessed by an expert in terms of its importance for the overall assessment of the website\u2019s usefulness.

To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a tool, called Website Accessibility Layer (WAL), which aims at both inserting accessibility features into existing Web pages at runtime and diagnosing accessibility issues through a dynamic source code analysis. The current version of the tool contributes to the accessibility of users with visual impairment, dyslexia, and reading difficulties, with respect to 13 Web page resources.

They do not work with people with disabilities in their studies on usability, and they do not consider web accessibility in their projects. Our findings also show that UXPs have a top-down approach to web accessibility and they think that it is the responsibility of project managers to make web applications accessible. In brief, the study showed that UXPs in Turkey need to be better educated and trained on web accessibility, and organizations need to realize that both top-down and bottom-up approaches are required to ensure accessibility of the web for all.", "venue": "Universal Access in the Information Society", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 22, "citationCount": 13, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2054172", "name": "Yavuz Inal"}, {"authorId": "2124264", "name": "Kerem Rizvanoglu"}, {"authorId": "1760899", "name": "Yeliz Yesilada"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "9716eca623e5c0ba8dbd85afd7388a1d52b4e270", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/uais/NavarreteL18", "MAG": "2594027799", "DOI": "10.1007/s10209-017-0529-9"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9716eca623e5c0ba8dbd85afd7388a1d52b4e270", "title": "Bridging the accessibility gap in Open Educational Resources", "abstract": "Open Educational Resources (OER) are being fostered as a global movement for providing educational opportunities to all. However, people with disabilities are still excluded from full participation because of the lack of accessibility of OER websites, as well as of the resources themselves. This work presents a proposal for the design of OER websites that would enable equitable access for all users. This design aims to bridge the accessibility gap through the personalization of the whole OER environment to facilitate an accessible User Experience (UX) based on a user profile that includes the self-identification of disability status. This profile configures not only the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the interface but also the delivery of educational resources suitable for this user profile. To achieve this purpose, the design goes beyond compliance with the ISO/IEC 40500 W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, since it includes the personalization of the accessible experience through usability considerations and adaptations of educational resources. The delivery of educational resources matches the user\u2019s profile with regard to their sensory abilities, cognitive faculties and their requirements of functionality control, display layout and language. As a proof of concept, we have developed an OER website based on this design and have conducted a set of UX tests that include users with different disabilities. The test results confirm the feasibility and suitability of our design regarding accessible UX. Finally, the contribution of this document arises from the explicit recognition of the particular needs associated with the disability profiles to establish the response of the entire OER system which enables a truly inclusive experience by exempting the user from performing configuration tasks.", "venue": "Universal Access in the Information Society", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 108, "citationCount": 20, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "143807211", "name": "Rosa Navarrete"}, {"authorId": "1405522947", "name": "S.
