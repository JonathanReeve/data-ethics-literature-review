The increasing presence of these new forms of interactive technologies, known as biowearables, in children\u2019s lives poses critical ethical concerns. In this position paper, we take a design ethics perspective to identify and describe four cases of ethical importance associated with biowearables, children, and long-term use. The cases concern potential negative impacts of specific aspects of biowearables on children\u2019s identity formation, the development of autonomy and agency, and what sources of information children turn to for authority about themselves. Drawing on ethical discourse related to emerging technologies and biowearable computing, we present prospective guidance for designers, where it is available. Where guidance is nascent or missing, we propose future research areas that could be addressed. In particular, we propose the importance of teaching children about computer ethics through hands-on critical reflection during design and technology activities.

However, despite the utmost relevance of quality and safety standards and their role for sustaining the innovation pathway of DHT, their actual making has not yet been subjected to in-depth social-science scrutiny.

However, weight stigma literature is generally limited by its focus on individuals' attitudes and beliefs, overlooking the broader social conditions shaping stigma. Further, few weight stigma studies have been conducted from young people's standpoint; little is known about how they navigate stigmatizing environments while growing up.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to examine the social organization of young people's everyday work of growing up in a larger body, interpreting work generously as any activity requiring thought and intention.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing institutional ethnography, we conducted individual interviews in Alberta, Canada with 16 informants aged 15-21 who grew up in larger bodies. Five, repeated group interviews were then held with a subset (n\u00a0=\u00a05) of these informants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWeight surveillance work (e.g., self-weighing on scales, social comparison) was informants' most common form of weight-related work while growing up. Surveillance results instructed them on next steps, whether that be working to fit in (literally and figuratively) or resisting social conformity altogether. Informants' bodies were monitored by nearly everyone around them: family, peers, educators, and healthcare providers. Informants learned how and why to do the work expected of them through social relations. Despite their (mostly) good intentions, surveillance by respected adults conveyed to informants that their self-worth depended on their weight. Biomedical, individuated health and weight discourses guided the enactment of institutional policies and practices in healthcare and education, such as those related to the Body Mass Index. These ruling discourses objectified bodies as normal or abnormal, healthy or unhealthy, good or bad.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall, study findings show how young people's experiences of growing up in their bodies were predictably organized by dominant weight and health discourses, identifying possible levers for public health intervention.", "venue": "Social science & medicine", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "13510765", "name": "Alexa R Ferdinands"}, {"authorId": "23024226", "name": "T.

Through a wide array of smart digital devices and apps, users are put on notice: are they aware of the screen time they accrue each day, the steps they have (not) walked, or the last time they stood up? In the resulting sphere of mediated self-awareness, sleep is ripe for calculation, analysis, and optimization. Essential yet unconscious, sleep is a practice that manifests as an ambivalent example of wider self-tracking logics; an alluring \u201cdata frontier\u201d for users and corporations alike. In this article, I draw on qualitative data (N\u2009=\u200938), collected in Australia, to explore the experiences and practices of self-trackers who monitor their sleep. Using interview data and participant screenshots, I discuss how apps construct sleep standards, social dimensions of sleep metrics, gamified incentives, and the process of assembling codes/spaces around sleep monitoring. In bringing sleep within a sphere of rational control, apps often exclude difference by focusing on consumer choice, wellness, and self-care.

These ideals take shape in relation to the fundamental uncertainty that parents/mothers face, an uncertainty that comes from not knowing how to do what is best for one's children, families, and selves. The growing body of parent-focused smart devices and data-tracking platforms emerging from this intersection frame the responsible parent as one who evaluates, analyzes, and mitigates data-defined risks for their children and family. As these devices and platforms proliferate, whether from respected medical institutions or commercial interests, they place new demands on families and add an implicit emphasis on how humans (often mothers) can be augmented and improved by data-rich technology. This is expressed both in the actions they support (e.g., breastfeeding, monitoring food intake), as well as in the emotions they render marginal (e.g., rage, struggle, loss, and regret). In this article, we turn away from optimization and self-improvement narratives to attend to our own felt experiences as mothers and designers. Through an embodied practice of creating Design Memoirs, we speak directly to the HCI community from our position as both users and subjects of optimized parenting tools. Our goal in this work is to bring nuance to a domain that is often rendered in simplistic terms or frames mothers as figures who could endlessly do more for the sake of their families. Our Design Memoirs emphasize the conflicting and often negative emotions we experienced while navigating these tools and medical systems. They depict our feelings of being at once powerful and powerless, expressing rage and love simultaneously, and struggling between expressing pride and humility. The Design Memoirs serve us in advocating that designers should use caution when considering a problem/solution focus to the experiences of parents. We conclude by reflecting on how our shared practice of making memoirs, as well as other approaches within feminist and queer theory, suggest strategies that trouble these optimization and improvement narratives.

Implications of Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers for Urban Governance", "abstract": "Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) such as blockchain have in recent years been presented as a new general-purpose technology that could underlie many aspects of social and economic life, including civics and urban governance. In an urban context, over the past few years, a number of actors have started to explore the application of distributed ledgers in amongst others smart city services as well as in blockchain for good and urban commons-projects. DLTs could become the administrative backbones of such projects, as the technology can be set-up as an administration, management and allocation tool for urban resources. With the addition of smart contracts, DLTs can further automate the processing of data and execution of decisions in urban resource management through algorithmic governance. This means that the technological set-up and design of such DLT based systems could have large implications for the ways urban resources are governed. Positive contributions are expected to be made toward (local) democracy, transparent governance, decentralization, and citizen empowerment. We argue that to fully scrutinize the implications for urban governance, a critical analysis of distributed ledger technologies is necessary. In this contribution, we explore the lens of \u201cthe city as a license\u201d for such a critical analysis. Through this lens, the city is framed as a \u201crights-management-system,\u201d operated through DLT technology. Building upon Lefebvrian a right to the city-discourses, such an approach allows to ask important questions about the implications of DLTs for the democratic governance of cities in an open, inclusive urban culture. Through a technological exploration combined with a speculative approach, and guided by our interest in the rights management and agency that blockchains have been claimed to provide to their users, we trace six important issues: quantification; blockchain as a normative apparatus; the complicated relationship between transparency and accountability; the centralizing forces that act on blockchains; the degrees to which algorithmic rules can embed democratic law-making and enforcing; and finally, the limits of blockchain's trustlessness.", "venue": "Frontiers in Sustainable Cities", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 123, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "authors": [{"authorId": "73777510", "name": "I.

Its quest for a compatible ethics has led it to Foucault\u2019s \u201ccare of the self,\u201d i.e., a transformation of the self by oneself through self-discipline. In this regard, technologies have been interpreted as power structures to which one can relate through Foucaultian \u201ctechnologies of the self\u201d or ascetic practices. However, this leaves unexplored how concrete technologies can actually support the process of self-care. This paper explores this possibility by examining one such technology: a gamified To-Do list app. Doing so, it first shows that despite the apparent straightforwardness of gamification, confrontation and shame play an important role in how the app motivates me to do better. Second, inspired by Ihde\u2019s schema of human-technology relations, it presents different ways in which the app may confront me with myself. Subsequently, it accounts for the motivation and shame that this technologically mediated confrontation with myself invokes through a Levinasian account of ethical subjectivity. In so doing, it also shows how Levinas\u2019 phenomenology implies a responsibility for self-care and how nonhuman, technological others may still call me to responsibility.

In this paper I engage with findings from an ethnographic study of Strava, a popular social fitness platform.

Second, I argue that there are many occasions in which there is a disharmony between objective and subjective body, and suggest that also in health, we cannot escape being an object that we often relate to. Then, I draw on postphenomenology to show how technologies such as digital self-tracking applications and digital twins can be understood as mediating the relationship with one\u2019s own body in a specific way.

The words \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018private\u2019 hold many meanings. This analysis focuses on how they are used both in an informational sense (what is kept secret or strictly controlled versus what is out in the open or shared) and an institutional sense (issues of ownership and purpose such as being state-owned and governed for the common good or privately owned and aimed at generating profit). In the political construction of digital infrastructures, the two senses are deeply intertwined: changes in relation to ownership and purpose affect what is kept secret and what is shared. Furthermore, when policymakers search for ways to protect one aspect (privacy) they sometimes opt for tools from the other (by conceiving of data as private property). The informational interconnectedness facilitated by digital infrastructures produces a form of \u2018data promiscuity\u2019. Data promiscuity is a condition where data are indiscriminate in the choice of partners: what is seen as data on a thing for one purpose can always become seen as data on another aspect of that thing and be used for another purpose and by another user. Data are set free to pursue gain or pleasure, but this freedom involves certain dangers for the persons from whom they derive. Data promiscuity is the contemporary condition of possibility for health research. By unpacking the wholesale categories of public and private through which the contemporary situation came about, there is a better chance of rethinking the problems it involves, and for suggesting new solutions to ensure social sustainability.

A thematic and narrative analysis of both sets of transcripts was conducted.

They called these practices \u201cconsciousness hacking\u201d and referred to research, financing, and design efforts around these wearables as a movement. Unlike Quantified Self practitioners who combine bodily self-tracking and population analytics to optimize health and productivity, these hackers prod their bodies to gain immediacy to their consciousness. By turning perception inward, they attempt to displace the mediation of technologies. They believe hacking the mind through data-driven stimulation can transform it into the ultimate medium for purposeful dreams, flow states, positive emotions, and secular revelations about the self, unconscious, and nature of experience. How do these practices reconcile New Age assumptions about the sacred essence of the self, with biopolitical assumptions about the self as a database to be rationalized according to the 24/7 demands of late capitalism? This essay uses media archeology to examine how discursive and material practices around consciousness hacking proffer a vision about the mind as medium that is futuristic yet ancient. By using the Consciousness Hacking movement as a starting point to investigate historical neuro-stimulative apparatuses for lucid dreaming, media archaeology can trace convergent trajectories of self-knowledge and self-making. This analysis traces connections from Bert Kaplan\u2019s 1950s database of dreams, to crowdfunded EEG headsets that promise to unlock the secrets of the collective unconscious using big data analytics.

The emergence of self-tracking technologies and their adoption and promotion in health insurance products has been characterized as a threat to solidaristic models of healthcare provision.

It would disrupt the distributive, solidaristic character that is expressed within all health insurance schemes, even in those nominally designated as private or commercial. Personalized risk pricing is at odds with the infrastructures that presently define, regulate and deliver health insurance. Self-tracking can be readily imagined as an element in an ongoing bio-political redistribution of the burden of responsibility from the state to citizens but it is not clear that such a scenario could be delivered within existing individual private health insurance operational and regulatory infrastructures. In what can be gleaned from publicly available sources discussing pricing experience in the individual markets established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (ACA), widely known as \u2018Obamacare\u2019, it appears unlikely that it can provide the means to personalize price.

It argues that self-measurement should be approached as an epistemic, relational, biopolitical and affective practice of valuation, which simultaneously produces knowledge about the self, enacts social and technological relations, reproduces bodily discourses and motivates affective modulation. In the three Instagram profiles studied, self-measurement appears to work according to two different logics: a logic of self-tracking that quantifies stages towards restitution and a logic of self-experimentation that \u2018visibilizes\u2019 bodily surface changes during illness. In terms of affect, self-tracking is primarily aimed at establishing a sense of hope \u2013 supported by encounters with followers and their displays of love and empathy \u2013 but it is also linked to frustration and fear when the goal of measurement is postponed or unreachable. Self-experimentation, on the other hand, takes part in processes that affectively relate to the aesthetically changing ill body \u2013 a mode of measurement that is less focused on temporal progression and more focused on exploring the vulnerable aliveness and changeability of the body during cancer by focusing on relations between present and past. Finally, the article discusses to what extent these two logics resonate with wider cultural and biopolitical transformations in which publicly visible and intensely circulated patient practices are increasingly those that are able to master and affectively \u2018grid\u2019 the destructiveness of illness while telling and sharing a story about it.", "venue": "Distinktion: Journal of Social Theory", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 121, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "73401483", "name": "Carsten Stage"}]}}, {"contexts": [], "isInfluential": false, "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "88e019b371374ae8c63d908a76f86e50fa619574", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2953435037", "DOI": "10.21860/J.10.1.12"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88e019b371374ae8c63d908a76f86e50fa619574", "title": "Digital medicine", "abstract": "The digital health industry is developing rapidly: many new subjects are involved in the field of medicine; new opportunities for distant medical services, diagnostics, monitoring of patients\u2019 health, and conducting medical research are emerging; electronic medical documentation is being developed, global medical information databases are being formed, etc. At the same time, the format of doctor-patient relationships is being transformed and new issues and challenges arise that require ethical evaluation.

As an alternative, this paper argues for fiduciary relationships, which put deliberative demands on digital health data controllers to keep the interests of their data subjects at the forefront as well as cater to the contextual nature of privacy. These deliberative requirements ensure that users can engage in collective participation and share their health data at a lower risk of privacy harms.

The PVDF film modified by an alkaline treatment could have the improved adhesion via the introduction of polar functional groups to its surface, which was confirmed by the ultrasonication. The surface hydrophobicity of the PPy electrode was enhanced by the DTMS coating, resulting in the improvement of the resistance to over-oxidation with a water contact angle of 111\u00b0.

A variety of scientific studies are based on physiological measurements from such rather low-cost wearables.

The answer to this question, undoubtedly impacts the reliability of a study\u2019s results. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to quantify the accuracy of low-cost wearables in comparison to high-quality laboratory sensors. We therefore developed a benchmark framework for physiological sensors that covers the entire workflow from sensor data acquisition to the computation and interpretation of diverse correlation and similarity metrics. We evaluated this framework based on a study with 18 participants. Each participant was equipped with one high-quality laboratory sensor and two wearables. These three sensors simultaneously measured the physiological parameters such as heart rate and galvanic skin response, while the participant was cycling on an ergometer following a predefined routine. The results of our benchmarking show that cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, inter-beat interval, heart rate variability) yield very high correlations and similarities. Measurement of galvanic skin response, which is a more delicate undertaking, resulted in lower, but still reasonable correlations and similarities.

More specifically, we discuss the processes of research and creation involved in the \u2018Dancing with Fitbit\u2019 project (http://labs.fluxo.art.br/dancing-with-fitbit/), oriented by the key question: How can we use data and the lived self-tracking experience to disrupt the biometric bodies produced by self-tracking technologies, as they intersect with ideals of \u2018successful aging\u2019?

The chapter examines how companies that own the knowledge integral to the IoT\u2019s functionality (the software) control that knowledge through intellectual property laws, especially copyright, and the ubiquitous surveillance of their customers. These companies retain control over the software even after its purchase, meaning they have a newly expanded regulatory capacity to monitor and control how their products are used.
