It also portrays them as supporters of both the State and the big corporations that employ them. However, counterexamples have also been documented historically in which engineers have supported social justice and sided in favor of labor and other social movements, sometimes even placing themselves in open confrontation against capital and the State. This chapter relies on ethnographic analysis to document the work of a group of engineers in Colombia who decided to create a space of exception to neoliberalism in the form of a Non-Governmental Engineering Organization (NGEO). These engineers had found that running their own NGEO provided them with some degrees of freedom to pursue social justice goals in their engineering work in ways not usually found in the corporate or neoliberal governmental worlds. However, these opportunities do not come without outstanding challenges, such as funding dependencies from a neoliberal government, which create contradictions that may hinder the engineers\u2019 pursue of social justice goals.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 16, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1403929555", "name": "R.
