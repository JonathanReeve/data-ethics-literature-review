It opens by reflecting briefly on the journal's transformations over the last 28 years before taking stock of the wellbeing of Cultural Studies, the field. The claim here is that Cultural Studies devotes less time and attention than it used to in thinking through first principles, and thus that the future of the field hinges, in part, on asking whether core concepts are up to the task of answering to the urgent political questions of our time. The essay then recontextualizes the concept of culture, specifically with respect to the much-maligned (indeed, deservedly-maligned) \u2018high culture\u2019 tradition. In its recesses the author identifies a fugitive theoretical line in which culture signifies care, as opposed to subordination to patrician interests and aesthetic styles. This conceptual move sets the stage for the central argument of the essay, namely, that for Cultural Studies to live up to both its name and intellectual-political ambitions, it must devote significant time to caring for the infrastructure that sustains its body of ideas. The piece concludes by highlighting some of Lawrence Grossberg's efforts, as an infrastructuralist, to care for Cultural Studies and by observing how, moving forward, neither the field nor this journal will take care of itself.", "venue": "Cultural Studies", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 171, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "97473757", "name": "Ted Striphas"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": ["This provides for an anxiety-provoking worldview in the age of HIV that constantly references the imaginary (social) anatomy, categorizing ab/normal, us/them, visible symptoms/invisible illness, and risk/non-risk (Erni, 1994).", "\u2026case of HIV, medicine has been invested not just in the refinement of health statuses through micro-technologies (e.g., HIV positive, negative), but also in the growth of identity categories to nominalize and make intelligible behaviors\nand types of people who are risky and \u201cat risk\u201d (Erni, 1994)."], "intents": ["background"], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "8c09f9a41ae5aa147d39c1a96f71eec2c13932af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2460119687", "DOI": "10.1080/10538720.2016.1191407", "PubMed": "27570436"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c09f9a41ae5aa147d39c1a96f71eec2c13932af", "title": "Fetishizing the health sciences: Queer theory as an intervention", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Queer theory often falls impotent in its palatability across disciplinary lines.

In the early 1980s, the CDC initiated a violence prevention program and in 1985 Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared violence an epidemic on the order of small pox to refigure violence in public health terms. Koop pointedly stated the goal: \u2018\u2018Our focus will be clearly on how the health professions might provide better care for victims of violence and also how they might contribute to the prevention of violence\u2019\u2019 (Koop, 1985/1986, p. 4). Similar efforts were made with respect to perceptions of obesity as well: \u2018\u2018Since the early 1980s, a relatively small group of doctors and public health officials, with substantial assistance from the weight-loss industry, has worked hard to get obesity understood as a disease\u2019\u2019 (Oliver, 2005, p. 612).

In defense of these policies, the President offered scientific arguments founded on the theories of Western \"AIDS dissenters.\" He also made the case that South Africa's unique experiences under apartheid demanded a strong tolerance of dissent and debate. The international condemnation of these views was striking. Over the course of the controversy, rhetoric played a central role in shaping the views of both sides. Advocates marshaled public arguments in response to the exigencies of the controversy. Contextual constraints also forced the rhetors to adapt their messages. Each chapter of this dissertation examines a different rhetorical element of the controversy. They include the cultural context of South Africa's transition to democracy, the development of AIDS dissent in the Mbeki administration, the early development of AIDS dissent in the West, the technical clash of scientific arguments in Mbeki's Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel, and indigenous social movement resistance to the government's policies.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 210, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "84726738", "name": "Marcus Paroske"}]}}, {"isInfluential": false, "contexts": [], "intents": [], "citingPaper": {"paperId": "4948f09ed2f9835cf835611c20d4c648bd61502e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.4324/9780203077887-37"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4948f09ed2f9835cf835611c20d4c648bd61502e", "title": "Compulsory Able-Bodiedness and Queer / Disabled Existence", "abstract": "When lesbian existence is imagined as a marginal alternative to the centrality of heterosexuality , it reinforces the notion that heterosexuality is naturally dominant.

If thinking about lesbian existence reveals \" compulsory heterosexuality, \" so too can we analyze \"compulsory able-bodiedness \" from the perspective of disability . Queer and feminist theorists have long critiqued the definition of heterosexuality as \"normal relations between sexes\" and insisted that homosexuality is subordinated because of the standard of normalcy. Disability studies also draws on critiques of normalcy , as demonstrated by Lennard Davis , and McRuer suggests that able-bodiedness is seen as even more \" natural \" than heterosexuality. Because ablebodiedness is considered a \" normal\" requirement for life in the industrial capitalist system , having an \" able body \" becomes compulsory . Like heterosexuality , able-bodied identity is defined by its repeated performances , and McRuer points out that many cultural institutions are dedicated to showcasing these bodily performances . There is a constant need to affirm able-bodied identity because able-bodied norms are in reality impossible to embody, and even the status of being able -bodied is only a temporary part of a human life . Since both queerness and disability have the potential to disrupt the performance of able-bodied heterosexuality , both must be contained and embodied by queer/disabled figures that \"can be tolerated\" in popular imagination.
