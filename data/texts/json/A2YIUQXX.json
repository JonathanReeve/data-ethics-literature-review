Increasingly, politicians, militaries, and government-contracted firms use these automated actors in online attempts to manipulate public opinion and disrupt organizational communication. Politicized social bots \u2014 here \u2018political bots\u2019 \u2014 are used to massively boost politicians\u2019 follower levels on social media sites in attempts to generate false impressions of popularity. They are programmed to actively and automatically flood news streams with spam during political crises, elections, and conflicts in order to interrupt the efforts of activists and political dissidents who publicize and organize online. They are used by regimes to send out sophisticated computational propaganda. This paper conducts a content analysis of available media articles on political bots in order to build an event dataset of global political bot deployment that codes for usage, capability, and history. This information is then analyzed, generating a global outline of this phenomenon. This outline seeks to explain the variety of political bot-oriented strategies and presents details crucial to building understandings of these automated software actors in the humanities, social and computer sciences.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.5210/fm.v21i4.6161", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 4, 5]], "date-time": "2016-04-05T15:30:52Z", "timestamp": 1459870252000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 79, "title": ["Automating power: Social bot interference in global politics"], "prefix": "10.5210", "author": [{"given": "Samuel C.", "family": "Woolley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "3470", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3, 10]]}, "container-title": ["First Monday"], "link": [{"URL": "https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/download/6161/5300", "content-type": "text/html", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/download/6161/5300", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3, 11]], "date-time": "2020-03-11T14:26:58Z", "timestamp": 1583936818000}, "score": 83.02192, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/fm.v21i4.6161", "ISSN": ["1396-0466"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1396-0466", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["Computer Networks and Communications", "Human-Computer Interaction"], "published": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3, 10]]}}
