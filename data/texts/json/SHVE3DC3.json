Variously adapted, they are handed down: in the process, they acquire almost doctrinal unassailability. One such parable, which has been retold in technology and urban studies for a long time, is the story of Robert Moses' low bridges, preventing the poor and the black of New York from gaining access to Long Island resorts and beaches. The story turns out to be counterfactual, but even if a small myth is disenchanted, it serves a purpose: to resituate positions in the old debate about the control of social processes via buildings and other technical artefacts - or, more generally, about material form and social content. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1177/030631299029003004", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2007, 3, 11]], "date-time": "2007-03-11T06:07:10Z", "timestamp": 1173593230000}, "page": "411-431", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 107, "title": ["Do Politics Have Artefacts?"], "prefix": "10.1177", "volume": "29", "author": [{"given": "Bernward", "family": "Joerges", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin f\u00fcr Sozialforschung, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; fax: +49 30 25 491-254 (or-684)"}]}], "member": "179", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 6, 29]]}, "container-title": ["Social Studies of Science"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/030631299029003004", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/030631299029003004", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2021, 4, 1]], "date-time": "2021-04-01T15:41:08Z", "timestamp": 1617291668000}, "score": 67.205475, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1999, 6]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"issue": "3", "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1999, 6]]}}, "alternative-id": ["10.1177/030631299029003004"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/030631299029003004", "ISSN": ["0306-3127", "1460-3659"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0306-3127", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1460-3659", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["History and Philosophy of Science", "General Social Sciences", "History"], "published": {"date-parts": [[1999, 6]]}}
