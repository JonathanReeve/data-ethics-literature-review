The behavioral and psychological mechanisms underlying the relationship between passion and conflict, and especially the case of work\u2013family conflict, are identified. Various forms of work-life conflict are delineated according to their core process (time-, strain- or behavior-based) and direction (work-family versus family-work conflict). The chapter more particularly focuses on the potential mediator role of several variables (including work time, work and family-specific behaviors, cognitions such as rumination, affects such as role tension) and the possible moderating role of other variables (sociodemographic variables, work and family characteristics). Theoretical and practical implications are offered, as well as suggestions for future research.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/oso/9780190648626.003.0010", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 7, 17]], "date-time": "2019-07-17T07:48:31Z", "timestamp": 1563349711000}, "page": "301-326", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Passion Toward Work and Work\u2013Life Conflict"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "Julie", "family": "Boich\u00e9", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Johan", "family": "Caudroit", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "286", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 7, 18]]}, "container-title": ["Passion for Work"], "original-title": ["Passion Toward Work and Work\u2013Life Conflict"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 7, 30]], "date-time": "2020-07-30T17:14:30Z", "timestamp": 1596129270000}, "score": 10.068387, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 7, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190648626.003.0010", "published": {"date-parts": [[2019, 7, 1]]}}
