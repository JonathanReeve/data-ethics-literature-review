Analyzing several high-profile accidents involving complex and automated socio-technical systems and the media coverage that surrounded them, I introduce the concept of a moral crumple zone to describe how responsibility for an action may be misattributed to a human actor who had limited control over the behavior of an automated or autonomous system. Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a component\u2014accidentally or intentionally\u2014that bears the brunt of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. The concept is both a challenge to and an opportunity for the design and regulation of human-robot systems. At stake in articulating moral crumple zones is not only the misattribution of responsibility but also the ways in which new forms of consumer and worker harm may develop in new complex, automated, or purported autonomous technologies.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.17351/ests2019.260", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 24]], "date-time": "2019-03-24T00:23:55Z", "timestamp": 1553387035000}, "page": "40-60", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 35, "title": ["Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales in Human-Robot Interaction"], "prefix": "10.17351", "volume": "5", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9647-1178", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Madeleine Clare", "family": "Elish", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "6932", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 23]]}, "container-title": ["Engaging Science, Technology, and Society"], "link": [{"URL": "http://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/download/260/177", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/download/260/177", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2021, 4, 21]], "date-time": "2021-04-21T09:58:50Z", "timestamp": 1618999130000}, "score": 70.31737, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 23]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.17351/ests2019.260", "ISSN": ["2413-8053"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2413-8053", "type": "electronic"}], "published": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 23]]}}
