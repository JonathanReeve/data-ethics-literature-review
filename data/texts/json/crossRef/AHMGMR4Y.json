Given a socio-technical context in which individuals are no longer the most authoritative source on data about themselves, wearable self-tracking technologies reflect the simultaneous commodification and knowledge-making that occurs between data and bodies. In this article, we look specifically at wearable, self-tracking devices in order to set up an analytical comparison with a key historical predecessor, the weight scale. By taking two distinct cases of self-tracking \u2013 wearables and the weight scale \u2013 we can situate current discourses of big data within a historical framing of self-measurement and human subjectivity. While the advertising promises of both the weight scale and the wearable device emphasize self-knowledge and control through external measurement, the use of wearable data by multiple agents and institutions results in a lack of control over data by the user. In the production of self-knowledge, the wearable device is also making the user known to others, in a range of ways that can be both skewed and inaccurate. We look at the tensions surrounding these devices for questions of agency, practices of the body, and the use of wearable data by courtrooms and data science to enforce particular kinds of social and individual discipline. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1177/1367549415584857", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 17]], "date-time": "2015-06-17T04:50:08Z", "timestamp": 1434516608000}, "page": "479-496", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 145, "title": ["Our metrics, ourselves: A hundred years of self-tracking from the weight scale to the wrist wearable device"], "prefix": "10.1177", "volume": "18", "author": [{"given": "Kate", "family": "Crawford", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Microsoft Research New York City, USA; MIT Center for Civic Media, USA"}]}, {"given": "Jessa", "family": "Lingel", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Microsoft Research New England, USA"}]}, {"given": "Tero", "family": "Karppi", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "SUNY Buffalo, USA"}]}], "member": "179", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}, "reference": [{"key": "bibr2-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1005502917533"}, {"key": "bibr4-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.1177/1461444812451565"}, {"key": "bibr5-1367549415584857", "volume-title": "Ethnographic assessment of quantified self meetup groups", "author": "Butterfield AD", "year": "2012"}, {"key": "bibr6-1367549415584857", "volume-title": "The Participatory Condition", "author": "Cohen JE", "year": "2015"}, {"key": "bibr7-1367549415584857", "volume-title": "24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep", "author": "Crary J", "year": "2013"}, {"issue": "2", "key": "bibr9-1367549415584857", "first-page": "273", "volume": "31", "author": "Czerniawski AM", "year": "2007", "journal-title": "Social Science History"}, {"key": "bibr17-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.5117/9789089642561"}, {"key": "bibr18-1367549415584857", "volume-title": "Never Satisfied: A Cultural History of Diets, Fantasies and Fat", "author": "Schwartz H", "year": "1986"}, {"key": "bibr19-1367549415584857", "volume-title": "Fat History: Bodies and Beauty in the Modern West", "author": "Stearns PN", "year": "2002"}, {"key": "bibr20-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.1089/big.2012.0002"}, {"key": "bibr21-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.1177/0163443708098245"}, {"key": "bibr22-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199970773.001.0001"}, {"key": "bibr23-1367549415584857", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "DOI": "10.1353/jsh.2010.0032"}], "container-title": ["European Journal of Cultural Studies"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1367549415584857", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full-xml/10.1177/1367549415584857", "content-type": "application/xml", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1367549415584857", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2021, 5, 5]], "date-time": "2021-05-05T16:11:57Z", "timestamp": 1620231117000}, "score": 48.748722, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}, "references-count": 13, "journal-issue": {"issue": "4-5", "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 8]]}}, "alternative-id": ["10.1177/1367549415584857"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367549415584857", "ISSN": ["1367-5494", "1460-3551"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1367-5494", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1460-3551", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "Education", "Cultural Studies"], "published": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}}
