This article defines commensuration as the comparison of different entities according to a common metric, notes commensuration's long history as an instrument of social thought, analyzes commensuration as a mode of power, and discusses the cognitive and political stakes inherent in calling something incommensurable. We provide a framework for future empirical study of commensuration and demonstrate how this analytic focus can inform established fields of sociological inquiry. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.313", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 27]], "date-time": "2002-07-27T11:48:40Z", "timestamp": 1027770520000}, "page": "313-343", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 867, "title": ["Commensuration as a Social Process"], "prefix": "10.1146", "volume": "24", "author": [{"given": "Wendy Nelson", "family": "Espeland", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Sociology, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208-1330;"}]}, {"given": "Mitchell L.", "family": "Stevens", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Sociology, Hamilton College, Clinton, New York 13323;"}]}], "member": "22", "container-title": ["Annual Review of Sociology"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.313", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2021, 10, 18]], "date-time": "2021-10-18T00:48:44Z", "timestamp": 1634518124000}, "score": 47.727974, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1998, 8]]}, "references-count": 133, "journal-issue": {"issue": "1", "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1998, 8]]}}, "alternative-id": ["10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.313"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.313", "ISSN": ["0360-0572", "1545-2115"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0360-0572", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1545-2115", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["Sociology and Political Science"], "published": {"date-parts": [[1998, 8]]}}
