Such engagement supports the exploration of public views on important social issues such as gender-based violence (GBV). In this study, we examine Big (Social) Data consisting of nearly fourteen million tweets collected from the Twitter platform over a period of ten months to analyze public opinion regarding GBV, highlighting the nature of tweeting practices by geographical location and gender. The exploitation of Big Data requires the techniques of Computational Social Science to mine insight from the corpus while accounting for the influence of both transient events and sociocultural factors. We reveal public awareness regarding GBV tolerance and suggest opportunities for intervention and the measurement of intervention effectiveness assisting both governmental and non-governmental organizations in policy development</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.7287/peerj.preprints.883v1", "type": "posted-content", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 12]], "date-time": "2018-01-12T15:44:51Z", "timestamp": 1515771891000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Gender-based violence in 140 characters or fewer: a #BigData case study of Twitter"], "prefix": "10.7287", "author": [{"given": "Hemant", "family": "Purohit", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States"}]}, {"given": "Tanvi", "family": "Banerjee", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States"}]}, {"given": "Andrew", "family": "Hampton", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Department of Psychology, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States"}]}, {"given": "Valerie", "family": "Shalin", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Department of Psychology, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States"}]}, {"given": "Nayanesh", "family": "Bhandutia", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "MIS Branch, United Nations Population Fund Headquarters (UNFPA), New York City, NY, United States"}]}, {"given": "Amit", "family": "Sheth", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States"}]}], "member": "4443", "link": [{"URL": "https://peerj.com/preprints/883v1.pdf", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://peerj.com/preprints/883v1.xml", "content-type": "application/xml", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://peerj.com/preprints/883v1.html", "content-type": "text/html", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://peerj.com/preprints/883v1.pdf", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2019-12-23T13:04:25Z", "timestamp": 1577106265000}, "score": 72.572464, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.883v1", "published": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 10]]}, "subtype": "preprint"}
