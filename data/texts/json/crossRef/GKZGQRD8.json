Although adults often refer to these practices with the language of \u201cbullying,\u201d teens are more likely to refer to the resultant skirmishes and their digital traces as \u201cdrama.\u201d Drama is a performative set of actions distinct from bullying, gossip, and relational aggression, incorporating elements of them but also operating quite distinctly. While drama is not particularly new, networked dynamics reconfigure how drama plays out and what it means to teens in new ways. In this paper, we examine how American teens conceptualize drama, its key components, participant motivations for engaging in it, and its relationship to networked technologies. Drawing on six years of ethnographic fieldwork, we examine what drama means to teenagers and its relationship to visibility and privacy. We argue that the emic use of \u201cdrama\u201d allows teens to distance themselves from practices which adults may conceptualize as bullying. As such, they can retain agency - and save face - rather than positioning themselves in a victim narrative. Drama is a gendered process that perpetrates conventional gender norms. It also reflects discourses of celebrity, particularly the mundane interpersonal conflict found on soap operas and reality television. For teens, sites like Facebook allow for similar performances in front of engaged audiences. Understanding how \u201cdrama\u201d operates is necessary to recognize teens\u2019 own defenses against the realities of aggression, gossip, and bullying in networked publics.</p>", "DOI": "10.31219/osf.io/aknux", "type": "posted-content", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 7, 2]], "date-time": "2018-07-02T10:45:16Z", "timestamp": 1530528316000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["The Drama!
