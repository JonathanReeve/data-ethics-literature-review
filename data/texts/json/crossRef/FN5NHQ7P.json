It explores the philosophical roots of the subject, explaining how modern formal logic deals with issues ranging from the existence of God and the reality of time to paradoxes of probability and decision theory. Along the way, the basics of formal logic are explained in simple, non-technical terms, showing that logic is a powerful and exciting part of modern philosophy. It also covers the subjects of algorithms and axioms, and proofs in mathematics.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/actrade/9780198811701.001.0001", "type": "book", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 11, 7]], "date-time": "2017-11-07T14:49:40Z", "timestamp": 1510066180000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["Logic: A Very Short Introduction"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "Graham", "family": "Priest", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "286", "container-title": ["Very Short Introductions"], "original-title": ["Logic: A Very Short Introduction"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 11, 7]], "date-time": "2017-11-07T14:49:40Z", "timestamp": 1510066180000}, "score": 64.7641, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10, 26]]}, "ISBN": ["9780198811701"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/actrade/9780198811701.001.0001", "published": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10, 26]]}}
